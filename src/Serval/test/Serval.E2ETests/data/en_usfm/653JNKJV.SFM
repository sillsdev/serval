\v 1 \sc The\sc* elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.  
\v 2 Beloved, I wish above all \add things\add* that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.  
\v 3 For I rejoiced greatly, when \add the\add* brethren came and testified of the truth \add that is\add* in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.  
\v 4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.  
\v 5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;  
\v 6 which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:  
\v 7 because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.  
\v 8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.   
\p
\v 9 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.  
\v 10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth \add them\add* out of the church.  
\v 11 Beloved, follow not \add that which is\add* evil, but \add that which is\add* good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.  
\v 12 Demetrius hath good report of all \add men\add*, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.   
\p
\v 13 I had many \add things\add* to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:  
\v 14 but I trust \add I\add* shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace \add be\add* to thee. \add Our\add* friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
