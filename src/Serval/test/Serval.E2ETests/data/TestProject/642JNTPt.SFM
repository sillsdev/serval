\s1 Greeting
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 3 John 1; [1 Pet. 5:1] \x*The elder to the elect lady and her children, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 John 3:18; 3 John 1 \x*whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who \x + \xo 1:1 \xt John 8:32; [1 Tim. 2:4; Heb. 10:26] \x*know \x + \xo 1:1 \xt John 1:17; 14:6; See Gal. 2:5\x*the truth,
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [1 Cor. 13:6]\x*because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt 1 Tim. 1:2; 2 Tim. 1:2; [Jude 2]\x*Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father’s Son, in truth and love.
\s1 Walking in Truth and Love
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt 3 John 3, 4\x*I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.
\v 5 And now I ask you, dear lady—\x + \xo 1:5 \xt 1 John 2:7 \x*not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning—\x + \xo 1:5 \xt See 1 John 3:11\x*that we love one another.
\v 6 And \x + \xo 1:6 \xt 1 John 5:3; [1 John 2:5]; See John 14:15 \x*this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just \x + \xo 1:6 \xt 1 John 2:24\x*as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
\v 7 For \x + \xo 1:7 \xt See 1 John 2:18, 26 \x*many deceivers \x + \xo 1:7 \xt 1 John 4:1 \x*have gone out into the world, \x + \xo 1:7 \xt 1 John 2:22; 4:2, 3\x*those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.
\v 8 Watch yourselves, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Gal. 3:4; Heb. 10:35] \x*so that you may not lose what we\f + \fr 8 \ft Some manuscripts \fq you\f* have worked for, but \x + \xo 1:8 \xt See 1 Cor. 3:8\x*may win a full reward.
\v 9 Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See 1 John 2:23\x*does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See 1 John 2:23\x*has both the Father and the Son.
\v 10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Rom. 16:17; Gal. 1:8, 9; 2 Thess. 3:6, 14; Titus 3:10]\x*do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,
\v 11 for whoever greets him \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [1 Tim. 5:22]\x*takes part in his wicked works.
\s1 Final Greetings
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt 3 John 13 \x*Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. \x + \xo 1:12 \xt 3 John 14 \x*Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt John 15:11; 17:13\x*so that our joy may be complete.
\p
\v 13 The children of your elect sister greet you.
