\v 1 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* that came to Hosea, the son of Beeri, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Isa. 1:1; Amos 1:1; Mic. 1:1 \x*in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 2 Kgs. 14:23; 15:1\x*Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.
\s1 Hosea’s Wife and Children
\p
\v 2 When the \nd Lord\nd* first spoke through Hosea, the \nd Lord\nd* said to Hosea, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [ch. 3:1] \x*“Go, take to yourself a wife of whoredom and have \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 2:4 \x*children of whoredom, for \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [ch. 2:5]; See Ezek. 16:15\x*the land commits great whoredom by forsaking the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 3 So he went and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
\p
\v 4 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to him, “Call his name Jezreel, for in just a little while \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [2 Kgs. 10:11] \x*I will punish the house of Jehu for the blood of Jezreel, and \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [Amos 7:9]\x*I will put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
\v 5 And on that day \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 15:29] \x*I will break the bow of Israel \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Josh. 17:16; Judg. 6:33\x*in the Valley of Jezreel.”
\p
\v 6 She conceived again and bore a daughter. And the \nd Lord\nd* said to him, \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [ver. 9; ch. 2:1, 23; Rom. 9:25; 1 Pet. 2:10] \x*“Call her name No Mercy,\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Hebrew \+tl Lo-ruhama\+tl*, which means \fq she has not received mercy\f* for \x + \xo 1:6 \xt ch. 2:4; 2 Kgs. 17:6, 23\x*I will no more have mercy on the house of Israel, to forgive them at all.
\v 7 But \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [ch. 11:12; 2 Kgs. 19:35] \x*I will have mercy on the house of Judah, and I will save them by the \nd Lord\nd* their God. I \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [ch. 2:18; Zech. 4:6; 9:10]\x*will not save them by bow or by sword or by war or by horses or by horsemen.”
\p
\v 8 When she had weaned No Mercy, she conceived and bore a son.
\v 9 And the \nd Lord\nd* said, \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ver. 4, 6 \x*“Call his name Not My People,\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebrew \+tl Lo-ammi\+tl*, which means \fq not my people\f* for \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ch. 2:23; [Lev. 26:12]\x*you are not my people, and I am not your God.”\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Hebrew \fq I am not yours\f*
\p
\v 10 \f + \fr 1:10 \ft Ch 2:1 in Hebrew\f* Yet \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Ezek. 36:10, 37] \x*the number of the children of Israel shall be \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Gen. 22:17; See Gen. 13:16 \x*like the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Cited Rom. 9:26 \x*And \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Isa. 62:4 \x*in the place where it was said to them, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*“You are not my people,” it shall be said to them, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Deut. 14:1; [2 Cor. 6:18] \x*“Children\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or \fq Sons\f* of \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Ps. 42:2; See Josh. 3:10\x*the living God.”
\v 11 And \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Isa. 11:12, 13; Jer. 3:18; 50:4; Ezek. 34:23; Zech. 10:6; See Ezek. 37:16-24 \x*the children of Judah and the children of Israel shall be gathered together, and \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [ch. 3:5]\x*they shall appoint for themselves one head. And they shall go up from the land, for great shall be the day of Jezreel.

\v 2 “Plead with your mother, plead—
\q2 for \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [Isa. 50:1] \x*she is not my wife,

\q1 that she put away \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [ch. 4:12; Ezek. 16:25]\x*her whoring from her face,

\q1
\v 5 For \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [ch. 1:2] \x*their mother has played the whore;

\q1 For \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [ver. 12, 13] \x*she said, ‘I will go after my lovers,

\v 7 She shall pursue her lovers
\q2 but not overtake them,
\q1 and she shall seek them
\q2 but shall not find them.
\q1 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [Luke 15:17, 18] \x*Then she shall say,

\q1 and \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [ver. 3; Joel 1:10]\x*I will take away my wool and my flax,
\q2 which were to cover her nakedness.
\q1
\v 10 Now \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Lam. 1:8; Ezek. 16:37; 23:29\x*I will uncover her lewdness

\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [Jer. 7:34; Amos 8:10] \x*And I will put an end to all her mirth,

\q1 I will make them a forest,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [ch. 13:8]\x*and the beasts of the field shall devour them.
\q1
\v 13 And \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [ch. 4:9] \x*I will punish her for \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [ch. 11:2; 13:1, 2] \x*the feast days of the Baals
\q2 when she burned offerings to them
\q1 and \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Ezek. 23:40; [Isa. 61:10]\x*adorned herself with her ring and jewelry,

\v 14 “Therefore, behold, I will allure her,

\s1 Hosea Redeems His Wife
\p \v 1 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [ch. 1:2, 3]\x*“Go again, love a woman who is loved by another man and is an adulteress, even as the \nd Lord\nd* loves the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love cakes of raisins.”
\v 2 So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and a \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Lev. 27:16; [Ezek. 45:11]\x*homer and a lethech\f + \fr 3:2 \ft A \fq shekel \ft was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams; a \fq homer \ft was about 6 bushels or 220 liters; a \fq lethech \ft was about 3 bushels or 110 liters\f* of barley.
\v 3 And I said to her, “You must \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Deut. 21:13\x*dwell as mine for many days. You shall not play the whore, or belong to another man; so will I also be to you.”
\v 4 For the children of Israel \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*shall dwell many days \x + \xo 3:4 \xt ch. 10:3, 7 \x*without king or prince, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [ch. 9:4] \x*without sacrifice or \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [ch. 10:1, 2] \x*pillar, without \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See Judg. 8:27 \x*ephod or \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See Gen. 31:19\x*household gods.

\s1 The \nd Lord\nd* Accuses Israel
\q1 \v 1 \x + \xo 4:1 \xt See ch. 5:1 \x*Hear the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, O children of Israel,
\q2 for \x + \xo 4:1 \xt Isa. 3:13, 14; Jer. 25:31; Mic. 6:2 \x*the \nd Lord\nd* has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land.
\q1 There is no faithfulness or steadfast love,
\q2 and \x + \xo 4:1 \xt [ver. 6, 14; Jer. 4:22; 5:4]\x*no knowledge of God in the land;
\q1
\v 2 \x + \xo 4:2 \xt [ch. 7:1] \x*there is swearing, lying, murder, stealing, and committing adultery;
\q2 they break all bounds, and \x + \xo 4:2 \xt [ch. 6:9; 12:14; Mic. 3:10; 7:2]\x*bloodshed follows bloodshed.
\q1
\v 3 Therefore \x + \xo 4:3 \xt Isa. 24:4; Jer. 4:28; Joel 1:10 \x*the land mourns,

\q1
\v 6 My people are destroyed \x + \xo 4:6 \xt [ver. 1; Isa. 5:13] \x*for lack of knowledge;

\q1
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7 \xt [ch. 13:6] \x*The more they increased,

\q2 they are greedy for their iniquity.
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9 \xt Isa. 24:2\x*And it shall be like people, like priest;
\q2 I will punish them for their ways
\q2 and repay them for their deeds.
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10 \xt Lev. 26:26; Mic. 6:14; Hag. 1:6\x*They shall eat, but not be satisfied;

\q2 to cherish
\v 11 whoredom, wine, and new wine,
\q2 which \x + \xo 4:11 \xt [1 Kgs. 11:4; Prov. 20:1]\x*take away the understanding.
\q1
\v 12 My people \x + \xo 4:12 \xt [Judg. 18:5] \x*inquire of a piece of wood,
\q2 and their walking staff gives them oracles.
\q1 For \x + \xo 4:12 \xt ch. 5:4; [ch. 2:2]\x*a spirit of whoredom has led them astray,

\q1
\v 13 \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Ezek. 6:13 \x*They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains

\q1 Therefore your daughters play the whore,

\q1
\v 14 I will not punish your daughters when they play the whore,
\q2 nor your brides when they commit adultery;
\q1 for \x + \xo 4:14 \xt [ch. 9:10] \x*the men themselves go aside with prostitutes
\q2 and sacrifice with \x + \xo 4:14 \xt Deut. 23:17 \x*cult prostitutes,
