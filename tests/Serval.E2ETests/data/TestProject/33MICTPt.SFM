\p \v 1 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* that came to Micah \x + \xo 1:1 \xt [ver. 14] \x*of Moresheth \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Isa. 1:1 \x*in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Amos 1:1 \x*concerning \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Isa. 7:9; Jer. 23:13\x*Samaria and Jerusalem.
\s1 The Coming Destruction
\q1
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 3:1, 9; 6:1, 2; See Hos. 5:1 \x*Hear, you peoples, all of you;\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Hebrew \fq all of them\f*
\q2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See Isa. 1:2 \x*pay attention, O earth, and all that is in it,
\q1 and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Mal. 3:5 \x*let the Lord \nd God\nd* be a witness against you,
\q2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Ps. 11:4; Jonah 2:7; Hab. 2:20\x*the Lord from his holy temple.
\q1
\v 3 For behold, \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Isa. 26:21 \x*the \nd Lord\nd* is coming out of \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Ps. 115:3 \x*his place,
\q2 and will come down and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Amos 4:13; [Deut. 32:13]\x*tread upon the high places of the earth.
\q1
\v 4 And \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Ps. 97:5; [Judg. 5:5; Amos 9:5, 13; Nah. 1:5]\x*the mountains will melt under him,
\q2 and the valleys will split open,
\q1 like wax before the fire,
\q2 like waters poured down a steep place.
\q1
\v 5 All this is for \x + \xo 1:5 \xt See ch. 3:8 \x*the transgression of Jacob
\q2 and for the sins of the house of Israel.
\q1 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [ver. 13] \x*What is the transgression of Jacob?
\q2 Is it not \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*Samaria?
\q1 And what is \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [2 Chr. 28:4]\x*the high place of Judah?
\q2 Is it not Jerusalem?
\q1
\v 6 Therefore I will make \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*Samaria \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [ch. 3:12] \x*a heap in the open country,
\q2 a place for planting vineyards,
\q1 and I will pour down her stones \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [1 Kgs. 16:24] \x*into the valley
\q2 and \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Ezek. 13:14\x*uncover her foundations.
\q1
\v 7 All \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [Hos. 8:6] \x*her carved images shall be beaten to pieces,
\q2 \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [Hos. 2:12; 9:1]\x*all her wages shall be burned with fire,
\q2 and all her idols I will lay waste,
\q1 for from \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [Hos. 2:12; 9:1]\x*the fee of a prostitute she gathered them,
\q2 and to the fee of a prostitute they shall return.
\b
\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Isa. 22:4] \x*For this I will lament and wail;
\q2 I will go \x + \xo 1:8 \xt See Isa. 20:2-4 \x*stripped and naked;
\q1 I will make lamentation \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Job 30:29; Ps. 44:19 \x*like the jackals,
\q2 and mourning \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Isa. 13:21\x*like the ostriches.
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [Hos. 5:13]\x*For her wound is incurable,
\q2 and it has come to Judah;
\q1 it has reached to the gate of my people,
\q2 to Jerusalem.
\b
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt 2 Sam. 1:20 \x*Tell it not in \x + \xo 1:10 \xt See 1 Sam. 17:4 \x*Gath;
\q2 weep not at all;
\q1 in Beth-le-aphrah
\q2 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Jer. 6:26]\x*roll yourselves in the dust.
\q1
\v 11 Pass on your way,
\q2 inhabitants of Shaphir,
\q2 \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [Isa. 20:4; 47:3]\x*in nakedness and shame;
\q1 the inhabitants of Zaanan
\q2 do not come out;
\q1 the lamentation of Beth-ezel
\q2 shall take away from you its standing place.
\q1
\v 12 For the inhabitants of Maroth
\q2 wait anxiously for good,
\q1 because disaster has come down \x + \xo 1:12 \xt See Amos 3:6\x*from the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 to the gate of Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 13 Harness the steeds to the chariots,
\q2 inhabitants of \x + \xo 1:13 \xt Josh. 10:3; 2 Kgs. 18:14, 17; 2 Chr. 32:9 \x*Lachish;
\q1 it was the beginning of sin
\q2 to the daughter of Zion,
\q1 for in you were found
\q2 \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [ver. 5; Hos. 13:1]\x*the transgressions of Israel.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore you shall give parting gifts\f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or \fq give dowry\f*
\q2 to \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [ver. 1] \x*Moresheth-gath;
\q1 the houses of \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Josh. 15:44\x*Achzib shall be a deceitful thing
\q2 to the kings of Israel.
\q1
\v 15 I will again bring \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [ch. 2:4; Jer. 6:12] \x*a conqueror to you,
\q2 inhabitants of \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*Mareshah;
\q1 the glory of Israel
\q2 shall come to \x + \xo 1:15 \xt See 1 Sam. 22:1, 2\x*Adullam.
\q1
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt See Isa. 22:12\x*Make yourselves bald and cut off your hair,
\q2 for the children of your delight;
\q1 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt See Isa. 22:12\x*make yourselves as bald as the eagle,
\q2 for they shall go from you into exile.
\c 2
\s1 Woe to the Oppressors
\q1 \v 1 \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [Isa. 10:1, 2] \x*Woe to those who devise wickedness
\q2 and work evil \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [Ps. 36:4]\x*on their beds!
\q1 When the morning dawns, they perform it,
\q2 because it is in the power of their hand.
\q1
\v 2 They covet fields and \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [Isa. 5:8]\x*seize them,
\q2 and houses, and take them away;
\q1 they oppress a man and his house,
\q2 a man and his inheritance.
\q1
\v 3 Therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd*:
\q1 behold, against \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Jer. 8:3; Amos 3:1, 2] \x*this family I am devising disaster,\f + \fr 2:3 \ft The same Hebrew word can mean \fq evil \ft or \fq disaster\ft , depending on the context\f*
\q2 from which you cannot remove your necks,
\q1 and you \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Isa. 2:11, 17] \x*shall not walk haughtily,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Amos 5:13\x*for it will be a time of disaster.
\q1
\v 4 In that day \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Hab. 2:6; See Num. 23:7 \x*they shall take up a taunt song against you
\q2 and moan bitterly,
\q1 and say, “We are utterly ruined;
\q2 \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [ch. 1:15] \x*he changes the portion of my people;
\q1 \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [ch. 1:15] \x*how he removes it from me!
\q2 \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [Ps. 68:6]\x*To an apostate he allots our fields.”
\q1
\v 5 Therefore you will have none \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Deut. 32:8, 9; [Josh. 14:1, 2]\x*to cast the line by lot
\q2 in the assembly of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\b
\q1
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt See Amos 2:12 \x*“Do not preach”—thus they preach—
\q2 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Amos 8:11, 12] \x*“one should not preach of such things;
\q2 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Amos 8:10]\x*disgrace will not overtake us.”
\q1
\v 7 Should this be said, O house of Jacob?
\q2 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*Has the \nd Lord\nd* grown impatient?\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebrew \fq Has the spirit of the \+bdit Lord\+bdit* \fq grown short?\f*
\q2 Are these his deeds?
\q1 Do not my words do good
\q2 to him who walks uprightly?
\q1
\v 8 But lately \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [2 Chr. 28:8]\x*my people have risen up as an enemy;
\q1 you strip the rich robe from those who pass by trustingly
\q2 with no thought of war.\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or \fq returning from war\f*
\q1
\v 9 The women of my people you drive out
\q2 from their delightful houses;
\q1 from their young children you take away
\q2 my splendor forever.
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ch. 1:11, 16] \x*Arise and go,
\q2 for this is no \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Deut. 12:9; [Heb. 13:14] \x*place to rest,
\q1 because of \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Lev. 18:25\x*uncleanness that destroys
\q2 with a grievous destruction.
\q1
\v 11 If a man should go about and \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Jer. 5:13 \x*utter wind and lies,
\q2 saying, “I will preach to you \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [Amos 2:12]\x*of wine and strong drink,”
\q2 he would be the preacher for this people!
\q1
\v 12 I will surely assemble all of you, O Jacob;
\q2 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [2 Kgs. 25:11] \x*I will gather \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See ch. 4:7 \x*the remnant of Israel;
\q1 I will set them together
\q2 like sheep in a fold,
\q1 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [Jer. 31:10]\x*like a flock in its pasture,
\q2 a noisy multitude of men.
\q1
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [2 Kgs. 25:10] \x*He who opens the breach goes up before them;
\q2 they break through and pass the gate,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [ch. 4:10] \x*going out by it.
\q1 Their king passes on before them,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Isa. 52:12]\x*the \nd Lord\nd* at their head.
\c 3
\s1 Rulers and Prophets Denounced
\q1 \v 1 And I said:
\q1 \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See ch. 1:2 \x*Hear, you heads of Jacob
\q2 and rulers of the house of Israel!
\q1 \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Jer. 5:5; [Ezek. 22:6, 27]\x*Is it not for you to know justice?—
\q2
\v 2 you \x + \xo 3:2 \xt [ver. 9] \x*who hate the good and love the evil,
\q1 \x + \xo 3:2 \xt [Ezek. 34:3]\x*who tear the skin from off my people\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Hebrew \fq from off them\f*
\q2 and their flesh from off their bones,
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt [Ps. 14:4; Isa. 3:15]\x*who eat the flesh of my people,
\q2 and flay their skin from off them,
\q1 and break their bones in pieces
\q2 and chop them up like meat in a pot,
\q2 like flesh in a cauldron.
\b
\q1
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See Prov. 1:28 \x*Then they will cry to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 but he will not answer them;
\q1 \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Isa. 1:15; See Deut. 31:17\x*he will hide his face from them at that time,
\q2 because they have made their deeds evil.
\b
\q1
\v 5 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* concerning \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Jer. 23:13, 32; Ezek. 13:10 \x*the prophets
\q2 who lead my people astray,
\q1 \x + \xo 3:5 \xt [Jer. 6:14]\x*who cry “Peace”
\q2 when they have something to eat,
\q1 but declare war against him
\q2 who puts nothing into their mouths.
\q1
\v 6 Therefore \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Ezek. 12:24; 13:23 \x*it shall be night to you, without vision,
\q2 and darkness to you, without divination.
\q1 \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See Amos 8:9\x*The sun shall go down on the prophets,
\q2 and the day shall be black over them;
\q1
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Zech. 13:4; [Jer. 37:19] \x*the seers shall be disgraced,
\q2 and the diviners put to shame;
\q1 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [Lev. 13:45] \x*they shall all cover their lips,
\q2 for \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See Amos 8:11\x*there is no answer from God.
\q1
\v 8 But as for me, \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [Jer. 6:11] \x*I am filled with power,
\q2 with the Spirit of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and with justice and might,
\q1 to declare to Jacob \x + \xo 3:8 \xt ch. 1:5; Isa. 58:1; [Ezek. 23:36]\x*his transgression
\q2 and to Israel his sin.
\b
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt See ch. 1:2 \x*Hear this, you heads of the house of Jacob
\q2 and rulers of the house of Israel,
\q1 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [ver. 2]\x*who detest justice
\q2 and make crooked all that is straight,
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10 \xt Jer. 22:13; Ezek. 22:27; Hab. 2:12\x*who build Zion with blood
\q2 and Jerusalem with iniquity.
\q1
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt ch. 7:3; Isa. 1:23 \x*Its heads give judgment for a bribe;
\q2 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt See Jer. 6:13 \x*its priests teach for a price;
\q2 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [ver. 5; Ezek. 22:25] \x*its prophets practice divination for money;
\q1 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Isa. 48:2 \x*yet they lean on the \nd Lord\nd* and \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Jer. 7:4; [Amos 5:14] \x*say,
\q2 “Is not the \nd Lord\nd* in the midst of us?
\q2 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [Jer. 23:17; Amos 9:10]\x*No disaster shall come upon us.”
\q1
\v 12 Therefore because of you
\q2 \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Cited Jer. 26:18 \x*Zion shall be plowed as a field;
\q1 Jerusalem \x + \xo 3:12 \xt [ch. 1:6] \x*shall become a heap of ruins,
\q2 and \x + \xo 3:12 \xt ch. 4:2 \x*the mountain of the house \x + \xo 3:12 \xt [Luke 13:35]\x*a wooded height.
\c 4
\s1 The Mountain of the \nd Lord\nd*
\q1 \v 1 It shall come to pass \x + \xo 4:1 \xt For ver. 1-3, see Isa. 2:2-4\x*in the latter days
\q2 that the mountain of the house of the \nd Lord\nd*
\q1 shall be established as the highest of the mountains,
\q2 and it shall be lifted up above the hills;
\q1 and peoples shall flow to it,
\q2
\v 2 and many nations shall come, and say:
\q1 “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 to the house of the God of Jacob,
\q1 that he may teach us his ways
\q2 and that we may walk in his paths.”
\q1 For out of Zion shall go forth the law,\f + \fr 4:2 \ft Or \fq teaching\f*
\q2 and the word of the \nd Lord\nd* from Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 3 He shall judge between many peoples,
\q2 and shall decide for strong nations far away;
\q1 and they shall \x + \xo 4:3 \xt [Joel 3:10]\x*beat their swords into plowshares,
\q2 and their spears into pruning hooks;
\q1 nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
\q2 neither shall they learn war anymore;
\q1
\v 4 \x + \xo 4:4 \xt See 1 Kgs. 4:25 \x*but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree,
\q2 \x + \xo 4:4 \xt Isa. 17:2 \x*and no one shall make them afraid,
\q2 \x + \xo 4:4 \xt See Isa. 1:20\x*for the mouth of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has spoken.
\q1
\v 5 For \x + \xo 4:5 \xt [Jer. 2:11] \x*all the peoples walk
\q2 each in the name of its god,
\q1 but \x + \xo 4:5 \xt [Zech. 10:12]\x*we will walk in the name of the \nd Lord\nd* our God
\q2 forever and ever.
\s1 The \nd Lord\nd* Shall Rescue Zion
\q1
\v 6 \x + \xo 4:6 \xt [ver. 1] \x*In that day, declares the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 \x + \xo 4:6 \xt See Ezek. 11:17 \x*I will assemble the \x + \xo 4:6 \xt Ezek. 34:16; Zeph. 3:19\x*lame
\q1 and gather those who have been driven away
\q2 and those whom I have afflicted;
\q1
\v 7 and the lame I will make \x + \xo 4:7 \xt ch. 2:12; 5:7, 8; Joel 2:32; Zeph. 2:7 \x*the remnant,
\q2 and those who were cast off, a strong nation;
\q1 and \x + \xo 4:7 \xt Isa. 24:23; [Dan. 7:14; Luke 1:33] \x*the \nd Lord\nd* will reign over them \x + \xo 4:7 \xt Ps. 2:6; Heb. 12:22\x*in Mount Zion
\q2 from this time forth and forevermore.
\b
\q1
\v 8 And you, O tower of the flock,
\q2 hill of the daughter of Zion,
\q1 to you shall it come,
\q2 the former dominion shall come,
\q2 kingship for the daughter of Jerusalem.
\b
\q1
\v 9 Now why do you cry aloud?
\q2 \x + \xo 4:9 \xt Jer. 8:19 \x*Is there no king in you?
\q1 \x + \xo 4:9 \xt [Isa. 3:3] \x*Has your counselor perished,
\q2 that \x + \xo 4:9 \xt Jer. 6:24\x*pain seized you like a woman in labor?
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10 \xt [John 16:20, 21] \x*Writhe and groan,\f + \fr 4:10 \ft Or \fq push\f* O daughter of Zion,
\q2 like a woman in labor,
\q1 for \x + \xo 4:10 \xt [ch. 2:13] \x*now you shall go out from the city
\q2 and dwell in the open country;
\q2 you \x + \xo 4:10 \xt Isa. 39:6, 7 \x*shall go to Babylon.
\q1 There you shall be rescued;
\q2 \x + \xo 4:10 \xt See Isa. 44:22, 23\x*there the \nd Lord\nd* will redeem you
\q2 from the hand of your enemies.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Now \x + \xo 4:11 \xt Zech. 12:3 \x*many nations
\q2 are assembled against you,
\q1 saying, “Let her be defiled,
\q2 and \x + \xo 4:11 \xt ch. 7:10; Obad. 12\x*let our eyes gaze upon Zion.”
\q1
\v 12 But \x + \xo 4:12 \xt [Isa. 10:7] \x*they do not know
\q2 the thoughts of the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q1 they do not understand his plan,
\q2 that \x + \xo 4:12 \xt [Joel 3:13; Hab. 3:12; Matt. 3:12; Luke 3:17]\x*he has gathered them as sheaves to the threshing floor.
\q1
\v 13 Arise and thresh,
\q2 O daughter of Zion,
\q1 for I will make your horn iron,
\q2 and I will make your hoofs bronze;
\q1 you shall beat in pieces many peoples;
\q2 and \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Lev. 27:28 \x*shall devote\f + \fr 4:13 \ft Hebrew \fq devote to destruction\f* \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Isa. 23:18 \x*their gain to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 their wealth to \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Ps. 97:5\x*the Lord of the whole earth.
\c 5
\s1 The Ruler to Be Born in Bethlehem
\q1 \v 1 \f + \fr 5:1 \ft Ch 4:14 in Hebrew\f* Now muster your troops, O daughter\f + \fr 5:1 \ft That is, city\f* of troops;
\q2 siege is laid against us;
\q1 with a rod \x + \xo 5:1 \xt See 1 Kgs. 22:24\x*they strike the judge of Israel
\q2 on the cheek.
\q1
\v 2 \f + \fr 5:2 \ft Ch 5:1 in Hebrew\f* \x + \xo 5:2 \xt Cited Matt. 2:6; [John 7:42] \x*But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah,
\q2 who are too little to be among the clans of \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [Heb. 7:14] \x*Judah,
\q1 from you shall come forth for me
\q2 one who is to be \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [Gen. 49:10; Isa. 9:6, 7; Jer. 30:21; Zech. 9:9] \x*ruler in Israel,

\q2 from ancient days.
\q1
\v 3 Therefore he shall give them up \x + \xo 5:3 \xt [ch. 4:9, 10] \x*until the time
\q2 when she who is in labor has given birth;
\q1 then \x + \xo 5:3 \xt [ch. 4:7]\x*the rest of his brothers shall return
\q2 to the people of Israel.
\q1
\v 4 And he shall stand \x + \xo 5:4 \xt Isa. 40:11; [ch. 7:14] \x*and shepherd his flock \x + \xo 5:4 \xt See Isa. 11:3-5 \x*in the strength of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 in the majesty of the name of the \nd Lord\nd* his God.
\q1 And they shall dwell secure, for now \x + \xo 5:4 \xt Ps. 72:8; Isa. 52:13; Luke 1:32\x*he shall be great
\q2 to the ends of the earth.
\q1
\v 5 And he shall be \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [Isa. 9:6; Zech. 9:10; Eph. 2:14] \x*their peace.
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 18:13] \x*When the Assyrian comes into our land
\q2 and treads in our palaces,
\q1 then we will raise against him seven \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [Isa. 3:2, 3]\x*shepherds
\q2 and eight princes of men;
\q1
\v 6 they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword,
