\s1 The Command to Rebuild the Temple
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ver. 15; ch. 2:10; Ezra 4:24; 5:1; Zech. 1:1, 7 \x*In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came by the hand of Haggai the prophet to \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See 1 Chr. 3:19 \x*Zerubbabel the son of \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See 1 Chr. 3:17 \x*Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See Ezra 3:2 \x*Joshua the son of \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Chr. 6:15\x*Jehozadak, the high priest:
\v 2 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: These people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 3 Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Ezra 5:1\x*by the hand of Haggai the prophet,
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [2 Sam. 7:2]; See Ps. 132:3-5 \x*“Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Neh. 2:3, 17; Isa. 64:11; Jer. 33:10, 12\x*this house lies in ruins?
\v 5 Now, therefore, thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [ch. 2:15, 18]\x*Consider your ways.
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Mic. 6:15 \x*You have sown much, and harvested little. \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Hos. 4:10 \x*You eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill. You clothe yourselves, but no one is warm. And he who \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Zech. 8:10]\x*earns wages does so to put them into a bag with holes.
\p
\v 7 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [See ver. 5 above]\x*Consider your ways.
\v 8 Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Ps. 132:13, 14] \x*I may take pleasure in it and that \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [ch. 2:9]\x*I may be glorified, says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*You looked for much, and behold, it came to little. And when you brought it home, \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [ch. 2:17] \x*I blew it away. Why? declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts. Because of my house \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [See ver. 4 above]\x*that lies in ruins, while each of you busies himself with his own house.
\v 10 Therefore \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Jer. 5:24, 25; Zech. 8:12]; See 1 Kgs. 8:35\x*the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.
\v 11 And \x + \xo 1:11 \xt 2 Kgs. 8:1; [Ps. 105:16] \x*I have called for a drought on the land and the hills, on \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Hos. 2:9 \x*the grain, the new wine, the oil, on what the ground brings forth, on man and beast, and \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ch. 2:17; Ps. 128:2\x*on all their labors.”
\s1 The People Obey the \nd Lord\nd*
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Ezra 5:2 \x*Then \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ver. 1 \x*Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ver. 1 \x*Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ch. 2:2\x*the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the \nd Lord\nd* their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the \nd Lord\nd* their God had sent him. And the people feared the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 13 Then Haggai, the messenger of the \nd Lord\nd*, spoke to the people with the \nd Lord\nd*’s message, \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 2:4; [Isa. 43:5]\x*“I am with you, declares the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 14 And \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [2 Chr. 36:22; Ezra 1:1] \x*the \nd Lord\nd* stirred up the spirit of \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [See ver. 12 above] \x*Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of \x + \xo 1:14 \xt ver. 1 \x*Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all \x + \xo 1:14 \xt ch. 2:2 \x*the remnant of the people. And they came and \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [ch. 2:4; Ezra 5:8]\x*worked on the house of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, their God,
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [ver. 1]\x*on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.

\s1 The Coming Glory of the Temple
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [Lev. 23:34, 36]\x*In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came by the hand of Haggai the prophet,
\v 2 “Speak now to \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 1:1\x*Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 1:1\x*Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say,
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Ezra 3:12] \x*‘Who is left among you who saw this house \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [ver. 9] \x*in its former glory? How do you see it now? \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Zech. 4:10]\x*Is it not as nothing in your eyes?
\v 4 Yet now \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Zech. 8:9; [Zech. 4:6, 7] \x*be strong, O \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*Zerubbabel, declares the \nd Lord\nd*. \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Zech. 8:9; [Zech. 4:6, 7] \x*Be strong, O \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Zech. 8:9; [Zech. 4:6, 7] \x*Be strong, all you people of the land, declares the \nd Lord\nd*. \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [ch. 1:14] \x*Work, for \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ch. 1:13\x*I am with you, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5 \xt See Ex. 29:45 \x*according to the covenant that I made with you when you came out of Egypt. \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Neh. 9:20 \x*My Spirit remains in your midst. \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Zech. 8:13, 15\x*Fear not.
\v 6 For thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Cited Heb. 12:26 \x*Yet once more, in a little while, \x + \xo 2:6 \xt ver. 21\x*I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land.
\v 7 And I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [Isa. 60:1]\x*I will fill this house with glory, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 8 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [1 Chr. 29:14, 16]\x*The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 9 \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [ch. 1:8] \x*The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts. And \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [Zech. 6:13; Eph. 2:14]\x*in this place I will give peace, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.’”
\s1 Blessings for a Defiled People
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 2:10 \xt ver. 18, 20 \x*On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt ch. 1:1\x*in the second year of Darius, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came by Haggai the prophet,
\v 11 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 2:11 \xt See Lev. 10:10, 11\x*Ask the priests about the law:
\v 12 ‘If someone carries \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Jer. 11:15 \x*holy meat in the fold of his garment and touches with his fold bread or stew or wine or oil or any kind of food, does it become holy?’” The priests answered and said, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [ver. 14]\x*“No.”
\v 13 Then Haggai said, \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Lev. 22:4, 6 \x*“If someone who is unclean by contact with a dead body \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Num. 19:22]\x*touches any of these, does it become unclean?” The priests answered and said, “It does become unclean.”
\v 14 Then Haggai answered and said, \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Isa. 64:6]\x*“So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, and so with every work of their hands. And what they offer there is unclean.
\v 15 Now then, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [ch. 1:5]\x*consider from this day onward.\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Or \fq backward\ft ; also verse 18\f* Before stone was placed upon stone in the temple of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\v 16 how did you fare? \x + \xo 2:16 \xt [ch. 1:6]\x*When\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Probable reading (compare Septuagint); Hebrew \+bdit Lord\+bdit*\fq , since they were. When\f* one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Amos 4:9; [ch. 1:9; Deut. 28:22] \x*I struck you and all the products of your toil with blight and with mildew and with hail, \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Jer. 5:3; Amos 4:6\x*yet you did not turn to me, declares the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [See ver. 15 above] \x*Consider from this day onward, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ver. 10 \x*from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Ezra 3:10; Zech. 8:9\x*the day that the foundation of the \nd Lord\nd*’s temple was laid, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [See ver. 15 above] \x*consider:
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19 \xt [Zech. 8:12] \x*Is the seed yet in the barn? Indeed, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing. But from this day on \x + \xo 2:19 \xt Joel 2:14\x*I will bless you.”
\s1 Zerubbabel Chosen as a Signet
\p
\v 20 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came a second time to Haggai \x + \xo 2:20 \xt [See ver. 18 above]\x*on the twenty-fourth day of the month,
\v 21 “Speak to \x + \xo 2:21 \xt ch. 1:1; [Zech. 4:6] \x*Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, \x + \xo 2:21 \xt ver. 6\x*I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,
\v 22 and \x + \xo 2:22 \xt Dan. 2:44; Zech. 12:9; [Matt. 24:7] \x*to overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and \x + \xo 2:22 \xt [Mic. 5:10] \x*overthrow the chariots and their riders. And the horses and their riders shall go down, \x + \xo 2:22 \xt [Zech. 14:13]\x*every one by the sword of his brother.
\v 23 On that day, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, I will take you, O \x + \xo 2:23 \xt [See ver. 21 above] \x*Zerubbabel \x + \xo 2:23 \xt [Isa. 43:10] \x*my servant, the son of \x + \xo 2:23 \xt ch. 1:1 \x*Shealtiel, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, and make you \x + \xo 2:23 \xt Jer. 22:24\x*like a\f + \fr 2:23 \ft Hebrew \fq the\f* signet ring, \x + \xo 2:23 \xt [Isa. 43:10] \x*for I have chosen you, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.”
