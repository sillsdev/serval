\s1 Greeting
\p
\v 1 Paul, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See Rom. 1:1 \x*called \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 2 Cor. 1:1; Eph. 1:1; Col. 1:1; 2 Tim. 1:1\x*by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
\p
\v 2 To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 6:11; [ver. 30]; See John 17:19 \x*sanctified in Christ Jesus, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See Rom. 1:7 \x*called to be saints together with all those who in every place \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See Acts 9:14\x*call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [See ver. 2 above]\x*Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\s1 Thanksgiving
\p
\v 4 I \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See Rom. 1:8\x*give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
\v 5 that in every way \x + \xo 1:5 \xt 2 Cor. 9:11; [2 Cor. 6:10] \x*you were enriched in him in all \x + \xo 1:5 \xt 2 Cor. 8:7; [ch. 12:8]; See Rom. 15:14; 1 John 2:20\x*speech and all knowledge—
\v 6 even as \x + \xo 1:6 \xt 2 Tim. 1:8; [2 Thess. 1:10; 1 Tim. 2:6; Rev. 1:2]\x*the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you—
\v 7 so that you are not lacking in any gift, as you \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Rom. 8:19; Phil. 3:20; Heb. 9:28; See Luke 17:30; 2 Pet. 3:12\x*wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Phil. 1:6; 1 Thess. 3:13] \x*who will sustain you to the end, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Col. 1:22 \x*guiltless \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ch. 5:5; 2 Cor. 1:14; Phil. 2:16; [Luke 17:24]\x*in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ch. 10:13; Deut. 7:9; Isa. 49:7; 2 Cor. 1:18 \x*God is faithful, by whom you were called into the \x + \xo 1:9 \xt 1 John 1:3\x*fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
\s1 Divisions in the Church
\p
\v 10 I appeal to you, brothers,\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church; also verses 11, 26\f* by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 11:18 \x*divisions among you, but that you be united \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Phil. 1:27]\x*in the same mind and the same judgment.
\v 11 For it has been reported to me by Chloe’s people that there is \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ch. 3:3\x*quarreling among you, my brothers.
\v 12 What I mean is that \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ch. 3:4; [Matt. 23:9, 10] \x*each one of you says, “I follow Paul,” or “I follow \x + \xo 1:12 \xt See Acts 18:24 \x*Apollos,” or “I follow \x + \xo 1:12 \xt See John 1:42\x*Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [ch. 12:5; 2 Cor. 11:4; Eph. 4:5] \x*Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you \x + \xo 1:13 \xt See Acts 8:16\x*baptized in the name of Paul?
\v 14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Acts 18:8 \x*Crispus and \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See Rom. 16:23\x*Gaius,
\v 15 so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.
\v 16 (I did baptize also \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 16:15, 17\x*the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)
\v 17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 2:1, 4, 13; [2 Cor. 10:10; 11:6; 2 Pet. 1:16]\x*not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
\s1 Christ the Wisdom and Power of God
\p
\v 18 For the word of the cross is \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ver. 21, 23, 25; ch. 2:14 \x*folly to \x + \xo 1:18 \xt 2 Cor. 2:15; 4:3; 2 Thess. 2:10 \x*those who are perishing, but to us \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ch. 15:2; [Acts 2:47] \x*who are being saved it is \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Rom. 1:16; [ver. 24]\x*the power of God.
\v 19 For it is written,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:19 \xt Cited from Isa. 29:14; [Job 5:12, 13; Jer. 8:9; Matt. 11:25]\x*“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
\q2 and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart.”
\b
\m
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20 \xt Isa. 19:12 \x*Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? \x + \xo 1:20 \xt ch. 2:6; 3:19; Isa. 44:25; Rom. 1:22; [ver. 26]\x*Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
\v 21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach\f + \fr 1:21 \ft Or \fq the folly of preaching\f* to save those who believe.
\v 22 For \x + \xo 1:22 \xt See Matt. 12:38\x*Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
\v 23 but we preach Christ \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Gal. 5:11; See 1 Pet. 2:8\x*crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
\v 24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ \x + \xo 1:24 \xt [ver. 18] \x*the power of God and \x + \xo 1:24 \xt ver. 30; Col. 2:3; [Luke 11:49]\x*the wisdom of God.
\v 25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
\p
\v 26 For consider your calling, brothers: \x + \xo 1:26 \xt ch. 2:8; John 7:48; [ver. 20]; See Matt. 11:25\x*not many of you were wise according to worldly standards,\f + \fr 1:26 \ft Greek \fq according to the flesh\f* not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
\v 27 But \x + \xo 1:27 \xt James 2:5 \x*God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; \x + \xo 1:27 \xt Ps. 8:2\x*God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
\v 28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even \x + \xo 1:28 \xt Rom. 4:17 \x*things that are not, to \x + \xo 1:28 \xt ch. 2:6; [Job 34:19, 24]\x*bring to nothing things that are,
\v 29 so \x + \xo 1:29 \xt Eph. 2:9; [Judg. 7:2]\x*that no human being\f + \fr 1:29 \ft Greek \fq no flesh\f* might boast in the presence of God.
\v 30 And because of him\f + \fr 1:30 \ft Greek \fq And from him\f* you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us \x + \xo 1:30 \xt [ver. 24] \x*wisdom from God, \x + \xo 1:30 \xt Jer. 23:5, 6; 33:16; 2 Cor. 5:21; Phil. 3:9 \x*righteousness and \x + \xo 1:30 \xt [ver. 2] \x*sanctification and \x + \xo 1:30 \xt Eph. 1:7; Col. 1:14; [Rom. 3:24]\x*redemption,
\v 31 so that, as it is written, \x + \xo 1:31 \xt 2 Cor. 10:17; [Jer. 9:23, 24]\x*“Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”
\c 2
\s1 Proclaiming Christ Crucified
\p
\v 1 And I, when I came to you, brothers,\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ver. 4, 13; [2 Cor. 1:12]; See ch. 1:17 \x*did not come proclaiming to you \x + \xo 2:1 \xt See Rom. 16:25\x*the testimony\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Some manuscripts \fq mystery \ft (or \fq secret\ft )\f* of God with lofty speech or wisdom.
\v 2 For I decided to know nothing among you except \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Gal. 6:14\x*Jesus Christ and him crucified.
\v 3 And \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Acts 18:1, 6, 12 \x*I was with you \x + \xo 2:3 \xt 2 Cor. 11:30; 12:5, 9; 13:4, 9; Gal. 4:13\x*in weakness and in fear and much trembling,
\v 4 and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ch. 4:20; Rom. 15:13, 19; 1 Thess. 1:5; 2 Pet. 1:16\x*the Spirit and of power,
\v 5 so that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men\f + \fr 2:5 \ft The Greek word \+tl anthropoi\+tl* can refer to both men and women\f* but \x + \xo 2:5 \xt 2 Cor. 4:7; 6:7; [Zech. 4:6; 2 Cor. 10:4; 12:9]\x*in the power of God.
\s1 Wisdom from the Spirit
\p
\v 6 Yet among \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Phil. 3:15; [ch. 3:1] \x*the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [James 3:15] \x*a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, \x + \xo 2:6 \xt ch. 1:28\x*who are doomed to pass away.
\v 7 But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Rom. 16:25, 26; Eph. 3:5, 9; Col. 1:26; 2 Tim. 1:9\x*which God decreed before the ages for our glory.
\v 8 None of \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Acts 13:27; See Luke 24:20 \x*the rulers of this age understood this, for \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See Acts 3:17 \x*if they had, they would not have crucified \x + \xo 2:8 \xt James 2:1; [Ps. 24:7-10; Acts 7:2]\x*the Lord of glory.
\v 9 But, as it is written,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [Isa. 64:4] \x*“What no eye has seen, nor ear heard,
\q2 nor the heart of man imagined,
\q1 what God has \x + \xo 2:9 \xt See Matt. 25:34 \x*prepared \x + \xo 2:9 \xt James 1:12\x*for those who love him”—
\b
\m
\v 10 these things \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Matt. 16:17; Gal. 1:12, 16; Eph. 3:3, 5; See John 14:26 \x*God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [Rev. 2:24]\x*the depths of God.
\v 11 For who knows a person’s thoughts \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Prov. 20:27\x*except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
\v 12 Now \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Rom. 8:15 \x*we have received not \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [1 John 4:4]\x*the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.
\v 13 And we impart this \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ver. 1, 4; See ch. 1:17 \x*in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, \x + \xo 2:13 \xt 2 Cor. 10:12\x*interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Or \fq interpreting spiritual truths in spiritual language\ft , or \fq comparing spiritual things with spiritual\f*
\p
\v 14 The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are \x + \xo 2:14 \xt ch. 1:18 \x*folly to him, and \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Rom. 8:7\x*he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
\v 15 The \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ch. 3:1; 14:37; Gal. 6:1; [Prov. 28:5]\x*spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Cited from Isa. 40:13; See Rom. 11:34 \x*“For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?” But \x + \xo 2:16 \xt [John 15:15]\x*we have the mind of Christ.
\c 3
\s1 Divisions in the Church
\p \v 1 But I, brothers,\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* could not address you as \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ch. 2:15; Rom. 7:14 \x*spiritual people, but as \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [ch. 2:14] \x*people of the flesh, as \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Heb. 5:13; [ch. 2:6]\x*infants in Christ.
\v 2 \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Heb. 5:12, 13; 1 Pet. 2:2 \x*I fed you with milk, not solid food, for \x + \xo 3:2 \xt John 16:12\x*you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready,
\v 3 for you are still of the flesh. For while there is \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Gal. 5:19, 20; [ch. 1:11; 11:18; Rom. 13:13]\x*jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
\v 4 For \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See ch. 1:12 \x*when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [ver. 3]\x*are you not being merely human?
\p
\v 5 What then is Apollos? What is Paul? \x + \xo 3:5 \xt 2 Cor. 6:4; Eph. 3:7; Col. 1:25; [2 Cor. 3:3] \x*Servants through whom you believed, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See Rom. 12:6\x*as the Lord assigned to each.
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ch. 4:15; 9:1; 15:1; Acts 18:4-11; 2 Cor. 10:14, 15 \x*I planted, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Acts 18:27 \x*Apollos watered, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [ch. 15:10; Col. 1:18]\x*but God gave the growth.
\v 7 So \x + \xo 3:7 \xt 2 Cor. 12:11; Gal. 6:3; [Gal. 2:6]\x*neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
\v 8 He who plants and he who waters are one, and each \x + \xo 3:8 \xt ver. 14; ch. 15:58; 2 John 8; [ch. 4:5; Gal. 6:4, 5]; See Matt. 16:27; Rom. 2:6\x*will receive his wages according to his labor.
\v 9 For we are \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Mark 16:20; 2 Cor. 6:1 \x*God’s fellow workers. You are God’s field, \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Eph. 2:20-22; Col. 2:7; [ver. 16; Ps. 127:1]\x*God’s building.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [2 Pet. 3:15]; See Rom. 12:3 \x*According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a \x + \xo 3:10 \xt ver. 11, 12; Rom. 15:20; [Rev. 21:14] \x*foundation, and \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [ch. 4:15]\x*someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.
\v 11 For no one can lay a \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Isa. 28:16 \x*foundation other \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [2 Cor. 11:4; Gal. 1:6, 7] \x*than that which is laid, \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [Eph. 2:20]\x*which is Jesus Christ.
\v 12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw—
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13 \xt ch. 4:5 \x*each one’s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed \x + \xo 3:13 \xt ver. 15; 2 Thess. 1:8 \x*by fire, and \x + \xo 3:13 \xt 1 Pet. 1:7\x*the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
\v 14 If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, \x + \xo 3:14 \xt See ver. 8\x*he will receive a reward.
\v 15 If anyone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [Ps. 66:12; Isa. 43:2; Jude 23]\x*but only as through fire.
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 3:16 \xt ch. 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:21\x*Do you not know that you\f + \fr 3:16 \ft The Greek for \fq you \ft is plural in verses 16 and 17\f* are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?
\v 17 If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For \x + \xo 3:17 \xt [2 Cor. 7:1]\x*God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 3:18 \xt [Isa. 5:21; Gal. 6:3] \x*Let no one deceive himself. \x + \xo 3:18 \xt [ch. 8:2; Jer. 8:8, 9]\x*If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
\v 19 For \x + \xo 3:19 \xt See ch. 1:20 \x*the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, \x + \xo 3:19 \xt Cited from Job 5:13\x*“He catches the wise in their craftiness,”
\v 20 and again, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Cited from Ps. 94:11\x*“The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile.”
\v 21 So \x + \xo 3:21 \xt ver. 4-6; ch. 1:12; 4:6 \x*let no one boast in men. For \x + \xo 3:21 \xt Rom. 8:28\x*all things are yours,
\v 22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future—all are yours,
\v 23 and \x + \xo 3:23 \xt 2 Cor. 10:7; Gal. 3:29 \x*you are Christ’s, and \x + \xo 3:23 \xt [ch. 11:3]\x*Christ is God’s.
\c 4
\s1 The Ministry of Apostles
\p \v 1 This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and \x + \xo 4:1 \xt [ch. 9:17]; See 1 Pet. 4:10\x*stewards of the mysteries of God.
\v 2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.
\v 3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.
\v 4 \x + \xo 4:4 \xt See Acts 23:1 \x*For I am not aware of anything against myself, \x + \xo 4:4 \xt Job 9:2, 15; Ps. 130:3; 143:2; [1 John 3:21]\x*but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.
\v 5 Therefore \x + \xo 4:5 \xt Matt. 7:1; Rom. 2:1; [Matt. 13:29] \x*do not pronounce judgment before the time, \x + \xo 4:5 \xt See John 21:22; Rom. 2:16 \x*before the Lord comes, \x + \xo 4:5 \xt ch. 3:13 \x*who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. \x + \xo 4:5 \xt 2 Cor. 10:18; See ch. 3:8\x*Then each one will receive his commendation from God.
\p
\v 6 I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers,\f + \fr 4:6 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may \x + \xo 4:6 \xt ver. 18, 19; ch. 5:2; 13:4\x*be puffed up in favor of one against another.
\v 7 For who sees anything different in you? \x + \xo 4:7 \xt John 3:27; [1 Chr. 29:14; James 1:17; 1 Pet. 4:10]\x*What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?
\p
\v 8 Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you!
\v 9 For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, \x + \xo 4:9 \xt See Rom. 8:36 \x*like men sentenced to death, because we \x + \xo 4:9 \xt Heb. 10:33 (Gk.); [Isa. 20:3]\x*have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10 \xt [Acts 17:18]; See ch. 1:18; Acts 26:24 \x*We are fools for Christ’s sake, but \x + \xo 4:10 \xt 2 Cor. 11:19 \x*you are wise in Christ. \x + \xo 4:10 \xt ch. 2:3; 2 Cor. 13:9\x*We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.
\v 11 To the present hour \x + \xo 4:11 \xt Rom. 8:35; 2 Cor. 11:27; Phil. 4:12 \x*we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and \x + \xo 4:11 \xt 2 Cor. 11:20, 23 \x*buffeted and \x + \xo 4:11 \xt [Matt. 8:20]\x*homeless,
\v 12 and we \x + \xo 4:12 \xt See Acts 18:3 \x*labor, working with our own hands. \x + \xo 4:12 \xt See 1 Pet. 3:9 \x*When reviled, we bless; \x + \xo 4:12 \xt See John 15:20\x*when persecuted, we endure;
\v 13 when slandered, we entreat. \x + \xo 4:13 \xt [Isa. 30:22; 64:6] \x*We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Lam. 3:45\x*the refuse of all things.
\p
\v 14 I do not write these things \x + \xo 4:14 \xt [ch. 6:5; 15:34] \x*to make you ashamed, but to admonish you \x + \xo 4:14 \xt 2 Cor. 6:13; 1 Thess. 2:11; 3 John 4\x*as my beloved children.
\v 15 For \x + \xo 4:15 \xt [ch. 3:10] \x*though you have countless\f + \fr 4:15 \ft Greek \fq you have ten thousand\f* guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For \x + \xo 4:15 \xt Philem. 10; [Gal. 4:19]\x*I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
\v 16 I urge you, then, \x + \xo 4:16 \xt ch. 11:1; Phil. 3:17; 1 Thess. 1:6; [Phil. 4:9; 2 Thess. 3:9]\x*be imitators of me.

\s1 Sexual Immorality Defiles the Church
\p \v 1 It is actually reported that there is \x + \xo 5:1 \xt 2 Cor. 12:21 \x*sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Lev. 18:8; Deut. 22:30; 27:20\x*for a man has his father’s wife.
\v 2 And \x + \xo 5:2 \xt See ch. 4:6 \x*you are arrogant! Ought you \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [2 Cor. 7:7-10]\x*not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
\p
\v 3 For though \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Col. 2:5; [1 Thess. 2:17]\x*absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing.
\v 4 When you are assembled \x + \xo 5:4 \xt 2 Thess. 3:6; [Matt. 16:19; 18:18; John 20:23; 2 Cor. 13:3, 10; 1 Tim. 5:20]\x*in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
\v 5 you are \x + \xo 5:5 \xt 1 Tim. 1:20; [Job 2:6; Acts 26:18] \x*to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [Prov. 23:14] \x*that his spirit may be saved \x + \xo 5:5 \xt See ch. 1:8\x*in the day of the Lord.\f + \fr 5:5 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq Jesus\f*
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 5:6 \xt James 4:16; [ver. 2] \x*Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that \x + \xo 5:6 \xt Gal. 5:9; [ch. 15:33]\x*a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
\v 7 Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
\v 8 Let us therefore celebrate the festival, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Ex. 12:15; Deut. 16:3 \x*not with the old leaven, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt [Matt. 16:6, 12; Mark 8:15; Luke 12:1]\x*the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
\p
\v 9 I wrote to you in my letter \x + \xo 5:9 \xt [2 Cor. 6:14; Eph. 5:11; 2 Thess. 3:6, 14]\x*not to associate with sexually immoral people—
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10 \xt [ch. 10:27] \x*not at all meaning \x + \xo 5:10 \xt Eph. 5:5; Col. 3:5; [ch. 6:9] \x*the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, \x + \xo 5:10 \xt [John 17:15]\x*since then you would need to go out of the world.
\v 11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone \x + \xo 5:11 \xt 2 Thess. 3:6\x*who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler—not even to eat with such a one.
\v 12 For what have I to do with judging \x + \xo 5:12 \xt See Mark 4:11 \x*outsiders? \x + \xo 5:12 \xt [ch. 6:1-4]\x*Is it not those inside the church\f + \fr 5:12 \ft Greek \fq those inside\f* whom you are to judge?
\v 13 God judges\f + \fr 5:13 \ft Or \fq will judge\f* those outside. \x + \xo 5:13 \xt [Deut. 13:5; 17:7, 12; 21:21; 22:21, 22, 24; Judg. 20:13]\x*“Purge the evil person from among you.”

\s1 Lawsuits Against Believers
\p \v 1 When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous \x + \xo 6:1 \xt [Matt. 18:17]\x*instead of the saints?
\v 2 Or do you not know that \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Dan. 7:22; [Matt. 19:28; Rev. 20:4]\x*the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?
\v 3 Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life!
\v 4 So if you have such cases, \x + \xo 6:4 \xt [ch. 5:12]\x*why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church?
\v 5 \x + \xo 6:5 \xt ch. 15:34; [ch. 4:14]\x*I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers,
\v 6 but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?
\v 7 To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. \x + \xo 6:7 \xt [Matt. 5:39, 40]\x*Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?
\v 8 But you yourselves wrong and defraud—even \x + \xo 6:8 \xt 1 Thess. 4:6\x*your own brothers!\f + \fr 6:8 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f*
\p
\v 9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous\f + \fr 6:9 \ft Or \fq wrongdoers\f* will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: \x + \xo 6:9 \xt ch. 15:50; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; 1 Tim. 1:9; Heb. 12:14; 13:4; Rev. 21:8; 22:15\x*neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,\f + \fr 6:9 \ft The two Greek terms translated by this phrase refer to the passive and active partners in consensual homosexual acts\f*
\v 10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
\v 11 And \x + \xo 6:11 \xt ch. 12:2; Eph. 2:2, 3; 4:22; 5:8; Col. 3:7; Titus 3:3 \x*such were some of you. But \x + \xo 6:11 \xt Acts 22:16; Heb. 10:22; [Titus 3:5] \x*you were washed, \x + \xo 6:11 \xt See ch. 1:2 \x*you were sanctified, \x + \xo 6:11 \xt Rom. 8:30\x*you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
\s1 Flee Sexual Immorality
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 6:12 \xt ch. 10:23\x*“All things are lawful for me,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful for me,” but I will not be dominated by anything.
\v 13 \x + \xo 6:13 \xt [Matt. 15:17] \x*“Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food”—and God will destroy both one \x + \xo 6:13 \xt Col. 2:22 \x*and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but \x + \xo 6:13 \xt ver. 15, 19 \x*for the Lord, and \x + \xo 6:13 \xt [Eph. 5:23]\x*the Lord for the body.
\v 14 And \x + \xo 6:14 \xt See Acts 2:24 \x*God raised the Lord and \x + \xo 6:14 \xt ch. 15:22, 23; [John 6:39, 40] \x*will also raise us up \x + \xo 6:14 \xt Matt. 22:29; [Eph. 1:19, 20]\x*by his power.
\v 15 Do you not know that \x + \xo 6:15 \xt ver. 13; Eph. 5:30; [ch. 12:27; Rom. 12:5]\x*your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
\v 16 Or do you not know that he who is joined\f + \fr 6:16 \ft Or \fq who holds fast \ft (compare Genesis 2:24 and Deuteronomy 10:20); also verse 17\f* to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, \x + \xo 6:16 \xt Matt. 19:5; Mark 10:8; Eph. 5:31; Cited from Gen. 2:24\x*“The two will become one flesh.”
\v 17 But he who is joined to the Lord \x + \xo 6:17 \xt Eph. 4:4; [John 17:21-23]\x*becomes one spirit with him.
\v 18 \x + \xo 6:18 \xt 2 Cor. 12:21; Eph. 5:3 \x*Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin\f + \fr 6:18 \ft Or \fq Every sin\f* a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person \x + \xo 6:18 \xt [Prov. 5:11]\x*sins against his own body.
\v 19 Or \x + \xo 6:19 \xt [John 2:21]; See ch. 3:16 \x*do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? \x + \xo 6:19 \xt See Rom. 14:7\x*You are not your own,
\v 20 \x + \xo 6:20 \xt ch. 7:23; [Acts 20:28; Heb. 9:12, 14]; See 2 Pet. 2:1 \x*for you were bought with a price. \x + \xo 6:20 \xt [Phil. 1:20]\x*So glorify God in your body.

\s1 Principles for Marriage
\p
\v 1 Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: \x + \xo 7:1 \xt ver. 8, 26\x*“It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman.”
\v 2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
\v 3 \x + \xo 7:3 \xt Ex. 21:10\x*The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.
\v 4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5 \xt [Ex. 19:15; 1 Sam. 21:4; Eccles. 3:5; Zech. 12:12-14] \x*Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, \x + \xo 7:5 \xt 1 Thess. 3:5\x*so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
\p
\v 6 Now as a concession, \x + \xo 7:6 \xt ver. 12, 25; 2 Cor. 8:8; [ver. 10, 40]\x*not a command, I say this.\f + \fr 7:6 \ft Or \fq I say this:\f*
\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7 \xt [Acts 26:29] \x*I wish that all were \x + \xo 7:7 \xt ver. 8; [ch. 9:5] \x*as I myself am. But \x + \xo 7:7 \xt ch. 12:4, 11; 1 Pet. 4:10; [Rom. 12:6] \x*each has his own gift from God, \x + \xo 7:7 \xt Matt. 19:11, 12\x*one of one kind and one of another.
\p
\v 8 To the unmarried and the widows I say that \x + \xo 7:8 \xt ver. 1, 26 \x*it is good for them to remain single \x + \xo 7:8 \xt ver. 7\x*as I am.
\v 9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, \x + \xo 7:9 \xt [1 Tim. 5:14]\x*they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
\p
\v 10 To the married \x + \xo 7:10 \xt See ver. 6 \x*I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): \x + \xo 7:10 \xt Mal. 2:16; See Matt. 5:32\x*the wife should not separate from her husband
\v 11 (but if she does, \x + \xo 7:11 \xt Mark 10:12 \x*she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and \x + \xo 7:11 \xt [See ver. 10 above]\x*the husband should not divorce his wife.
\p
\v 12 To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.
\v 13 If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.
\v 14 For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. \x + \xo 7:14 \xt Ezra 9:2; Mal. 2:15\x*Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
\v 15 But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you\f + \fr 7:15 \ft Some manuscripts \fq us\f* \x + \xo 7:15 \xt Col. 3:15; See Rom. 14:19\x*to peace.
\v 16 For how do you know, wife, \x + \xo 7:16 \xt 1 Pet. 3:1; See Rom. 11:14\x*whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
\s1 Live as You Are Called
\p
\v 17 Only let each person lead the life\f + \fr 7:17 \ft Or \fq each person walk in the way\f* \x + \xo 7:17 \xt See Rom. 12:3 \x*that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. \x + \xo 7:17 \xt ch. 4:17 \x*This is my rule in \x + \xo 7:17 \xt 2 Cor. 8:18; 11:28\x*all the churches.
\v 18 Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? \x + \xo 7:18 \xt Acts 15:1, 5, 19, 24, 28; Gal. 5:2\x*Let him not seek circumcision.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19 \xt Gal. 3:28; 5:6; 6:15; Col. 3:11 \x*For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but \x + \xo 7:19 \xt See 1 John 2:3\x*keeping the commandments of God.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20 \xt ver. 24\x*Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called.
\v 21 Were you a bondservant\f + \fr 7:21 \ft Or \fq slave\ft ; also twice in verse 22 (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.)
\v 22 For he who was called in the Lord as a bondservant is \x + \xo 7:22 \xt [Col. 3:24; Philem. 16]; See John 8:36 \x*a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is \x + \xo 7:22 \xt [ch. 9:21; 1 Pet. 2:16]\x*a bondservant of Christ.
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23 \xt See ch. 6:20 \x*You were bought with a price; \x + \xo 7:23 \xt Lev. 25:42, 55\x*do not become bondservants\f + \fr 7:23 \ft Or \fq slaves \ft (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* of men.
\v 24 So, brothers,\f + \fr 7:24 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verse 29\f* \x + \xo 7:24 \xt ver. 20\x*in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.
\s1 The Unmarried and the Widowed
\p
\v 25 Now concerning\f + \fr 7:25 \ft The expression \fq Now concerning \ft introduces a reply to a question in the Corinthians’ letter; see 7:1\f* the betrothed,\f + \fr 7:25 \ft Greek \fq virgins\f* \x + \xo 7:25 \xt See ver. 6 \x*I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as \x + \xo 7:25 \xt 2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:13, 16 \x*one who by the Lord’s mercy is \x + \xo 7:25 \xt ch. 4:2\x*trustworthy.
\v 26 I think that in view of the present\f + \fr 7:26 \ft Or \fq impending\f* distress \x + \xo 7:26 \xt ver. 1, 8\x*it is good for a person to remain as he is.
\v 27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
\v 28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman\f + \fr 7:28 \ft Greek \fq virgin\ft ; also verse 34\f* marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that.
\v 29 This is what I mean, brothers: \x + \xo 7:29 \xt See Rom. 13:11\x*the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none,
\v 30 and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy \x + \xo 7:30 \xt 2 Cor. 6:10\x*as though they had no goods,
\v 31 and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For \x + \xo 7:31 \xt Ps. 39:6; James 1:10; 1 Pet. 1:24; 4:7; 1 John 2:17\x*the present form of this world is passing away.
\p
\v 32 I want you to be \x + \xo 7:32 \xt See Matt. 6:25; Luke 10:41 \x*free from anxieties. \x + \xo 7:32 \xt [1 Tim. 5:5]\x*The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.
\v 33 But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife,
\v 34 and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband.
\v 35 I say this for your own benefit, \x + \xo 7:35 \xt [Prov. 22:25]\x*not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.
\p
\v 36 If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed,\f + \fr 7:36 \ft Greek \fq virgin\ft ; also verses 37, 38\f* if his\f + \fr 7:36 \ft Or \fq her\f* passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry—it is no sin.
\v 37 But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.
\v 38 So then he who marries his betrothed \x + \xo 7:38 \xt Heb. 13:4\x*does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.
\p
\v 39 \x + \xo 7:39 \xt Rom. 7:2 \x*A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only \x + \xo 7:39 \xt [2 Cor. 6:14]\x*in the Lord.
\v 40 Yet \x + \xo 7:40 \xt See ver. 6 \x*in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think \x + \xo 7:40 \xt [Acts 15:28]\x*that I too have the Spirit of God.
\c 8
\s1 Food Offered to Idols
\p \v 1 Now concerning\f + \fr 8:1 \ft The expression \fq Now concerning \ft introduces a reply to a question in the Corinthians’ letter; see 7:1\f* \x + \xo 8:1 \xt ver. 4, 7, 10; See Acts 15:29 \x*food offered to idols: we know that \x + \xo 8:1 \xt See Rom. 15:14 \x*“all of us possess knowledge.” This “knowledge” \x + \xo 8:1 \xt Rom. 14:3 \x*puffs up, \x + \xo 8:1 \xt ch. 13:4-13\x*but love builds up.
\v 2 \x + \xo 8:2 \xt Gal. 6:3; [ch. 3:18] \x*If anyone imagines that he knows something, \x + \xo 8:2 \xt [ch. 13:8, 9, 12; 1 Tim. 6:3, 4]\x*he does not yet know as he ought to know.
\v 3 But if anyone loves God, \x + \xo 8:3 \xt Gal. 4:9; [Ex. 33:12, 17; Jer. 1:5; Nah. 1:7; 2 Tim. 2:19]\x*he is known by God.\f + \fr 8:3 \ft Greek \fq him\f*
\p
\v 4 Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that \x + \xo 8:4 \xt ch. 10:19; Isa. 41:24; [Acts 14:15] \x*“an idol has no real existence,” and that \x + \xo 8:4 \xt ver. 6; See Deut. 4:35, 39\x*“there is no God but one.”
\v 5 For although there may be \x + \xo 8:5 \xt 2 Thess. 2:4\x*so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”—
\v 6 yet \x + \xo 8:6 \xt ver. 4; Mal. 2:10; Eph. 4:6 \x*for us there is one God, the Father, \x + \xo 8:6 \xt See Rom. 11:36 \x*from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and \x + \xo 8:6 \xt Eph. 4:5; [ch. 1:2; 1 Tim. 2:5]; See John 13:13 \x*one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and \x + \xo 8:6 \xt John 1:3; Col. 1:16\x*through whom we exist.
\p
\v 7 However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, \x + \xo 8:7 \xt [Rom. 14:14, 22, 23] \x*through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and \x + \xo 8:7 \xt ch. 10:25, 28, 29\x*their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
\v 8 \x + \xo 8:8 \xt Rom. 14:17\x*Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
\v 9 But take care \x + \xo 8:9 \xt [ch. 10:23; Rom. 14:21; Gal. 5:13] \x*that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block \x + \xo 8:9 \xt Rom. 14:1, 2\x*to the weak.
\v 10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating\f + \fr 8:10 \ft Greek \fq reclining at table\f* in an idol’s temple, will he not be encouraged,\f + \fr 8:10 \ft Or \fq fortified\ft ; Greek \fq built up\f* if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?
\v 11 And so by your knowledge this weak person is \x + \xo 8:11 \xt Rom. 14:15, 20\x*destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.
\v 12 Thus, sinning against your brothers\f + \fr 8:12 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* and \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [Zech. 2:8; Matt. 18:6] \x*wounding their conscience when it is weak, \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [Matt. 25:45]\x*you sin against Christ.
\v 13 Therefore, \x + \xo 8:13 \xt Rom. 14:13, 21; [2 Cor. 6:3; 11:29]\x*if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.

\p \v 1 \x + \xo 9:1 \xt ver. 19 \x*Am I not free? \x + \xo 9:1 \xt Acts 14:14; 2 Cor. 12:12; 1 Thess. 2:6; [2 Cor. 10:7; Rev. 2:2] \x*Am I not an apostle? \x + \xo 9:1 \xt ch. 15:8; Acts 9:3, 17; 18:9; 22:14, 18; 23:11 \x*Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? \x + \xo 9:1 \xt See ch. 3:6\x*Are not you my workmanship in the Lord?
\v 2 If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are \x + \xo 9:2 \xt [2 Cor. 3:2]\x*the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
\p
\v 3 This is my defense to those who would examine me.
\v 4 \x + \xo 9:4 \xt ver. 14; 1 Thess. 2:6, 9; 2 Thess. 3:8, 9\x*Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
\v 5 \x + \xo 9:5 \xt [ch. 7:7] \x*Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife,\f + \fr 9:5 \ft Greek \fq a sister as wife\f* as do the other apostles and \x + \xo 9:5 \xt See Matt. 12:46 \x*the brothers of the Lord and \x + \xo 9:5 \xt Matt. 8:14; See John 1:42\x*Cephas?
\v 6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7 \xt 2 Cor. 10:4; 1 Tim. 1:18; 2 Tim. 2:3, 4 \x*Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? \x + \xo 9:7 \xt [ch. 3:6-8; Deut. 20:6; Prov. 27:18; Song 8:12]\x*Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
\p
\v 8 Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same?
\v 9 For it is written in the Law of Moses, \x + \xo 9:9 \xt 1 Tim. 5:18; Cited from Deut. 25:4\x*“You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.” Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
\v 10 Does he not certainly speak for our sake? It was written \x + \xo 9:10 \xt See Rom. 4:24 \x*for our sake, because \x + \xo 9:10 \xt 2 Tim. 2:6\x*the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11 \xt [Rom. 15:27; Gal. 6:6]\x*If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
\v 12 If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more?
\p Nevertheless, \x + \xo 9:12 \xt ver. 15, 18; See Acts 20:33 \x*we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything \x + \xo 9:12 \xt [2 Cor. 6:3; 11:12]\x*rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
\v 13 Do you not know that \x + \xo 9:13 \xt Lev. 6:16, 26; 7:6; Num. 5:9, 10; 18:8-20; Deut. 18:1\x*those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?
\v 14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ver. 4; Matt. 10:10\x*those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
\p
\v 15 But \x + \xo 9:15 \xt See Acts 18:3 \x*I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone \x + \xo 9:15 \xt 2 Cor. 11:10\x*deprive me of my ground for boasting.
\v 16 For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For \x + \xo 9:16 \xt [Acts 4:20; 9:6; Rom. 1:14]\x*necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
\v 17 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with \x + \xo 9:17 \xt ch. 4:1; Gal. 2:7; [Phil. 1:16]\x*a stewardship.
\v 18 What then is my reward? That in my preaching \x + \xo 9:18 \xt 2 Cor. 11:7; 12:13\x*I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
\p
\v 19 For \x + \xo 9:19 \xt ver. 1; [ch. 10:29] \x*though I am free from all, \x + \xo 9:19 \xt [Gal. 5:13] \x*I have made myself a servant to all, that I might \x + \xo 9:19 \xt Matt. 18:15; 1 Pet. 3:1\x*win more of them.
\v 20 \x + \xo 9:20 \xt Acts 16:3; 21:23-26\x*To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.
\v 21 To \x + \xo 9:21 \xt Rom. 2:12, 14 \x*those outside the law I became \x + \xo 9:21 \xt [Gal. 2:3; 3:2] \x*as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but \x + \xo 9:21 \xt See ch. 7:22\x*under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.
\v 22 \x + \xo 9:22 \xt 2 Cor. 11:29 \x*To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. \x + \xo 9:22 \xt ch. 10:33 \x*I have become all things to all people, that \x + \xo 9:22 \xt ch. 7:16; Rom. 11:14\x*by all means I might save some.
\v 23 I do it all for the sake of the gospel, \x + \xo 9:23 \xt [ch. 10:24]\x*that I may share with them in its blessings.
\p
\v 24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives \x + \xo 9:24 \xt Phil. 3:14; Col. 2:18 \x*the prize? So \x + \xo 9:24 \xt Gal. 2:2; 5:7; Phil. 2:16; Heb. 12:1; [2 Tim. 4:7]\x*run that you may obtain it.
\v 25 Every \x + \xo 9:25 \xt 1 Tim. 6:12; 2 Tim. 2:5; 4:7; [Jude 3] \x*athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we \x + \xo 9:25 \xt See James 1:12\x*an imperishable.
\v 26 So I do not run aimlessly; I \x + \xo 9:26 \xt [Heb. 12:4] \x*do not box as one \x + \xo 9:26 \xt [ch. 14:9]\x*beating the air.
\v 27 But I discipline my body and \x + \xo 9:27 \xt [Rom. 6:19] \x*keep it under control,\f + \fr 9:27 \ft Greek \fq I pummel my body and make it a slave\f* lest after preaching to others \x + \xo 9:27 \xt [Song 1:6] \x*I myself should be \x + \xo 9:27 \xt [Jer. 6:30; Rom. 1:28; Heb. 6:8]\x*disqualified.

\s1 Warning Against Idolatry
\p \v 1 For I do not want you to be unaware, brothers,\f + \fr 10:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* that our fathers were all under \x + \xo 10:1 \xt See Ex. 13:21 \x*the cloud, and all \x + \xo 10:1 \xt See Ex. 14:22\x*passed through the sea,
\v 2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
\v 3 and \x + \xo 10:3 \xt Ex. 16:15, 35; Deut. 8:3; Neh. 9:15, 20; Ps. 78:24 \x*all ate the same \x + \xo 10:3 \xt Ps. 78:25; 105:40; John 6:31\x*spiritual food,
\v 4 and \x + \xo 10:4 \xt See Ex. 17:6\x*all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.
\v 5 Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for \x + \xo 10:5 \xt Num. 14:29, 37; 26:64, 65; Ps. 106:26; Heb. 3:17; Jude 5\x*they were overthrown\f + \fr 10:5 \ft Or \fq were laid low\f* in the wilderness.
\p
\v 6 Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as \x + \xo 10:6 \xt Num. 11:4, 33, 34; Ps. 78:18; 106:14\x*they did.
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7 \xt ver. 14 \x*Do not be idolaters \x + \xo 10:7 \xt Ex. 32:4 \x*as some of them were; as it is written, \x + \xo 10:7 \xt Cited from Ex. 32:6\x*“The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.”
\v 8 \x + \xo 10:8 \xt See ch. 6:18; Acts 15:20 \x*We must not indulge in sexual immorality \x + \xo 10:8 \xt Num. 25:1 \x*as some of them did, and \x + \xo 10:8 \xt [Num. 25:9; Ps. 106:29]\x*twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
\v 9 We must not put Christ\f + \fr 10:9 \ft Some manuscripts \fq the Lord\f* to the test, \x + \xo 10:9 \xt Num. 21:5; [Ex. 17:2, 7]; See Ps. 78:18 \x*as some of them did and \x + \xo 10:9 \xt See Num. 21:6\x*were destroyed by serpents,
\v 10 nor grumble, \x + \xo 10:10 \xt See Num. 14:2 \x*as some of them did and \x + \xo 10:10 \xt Num. 14:29-37 \x*were destroyed by \x + \xo 10:10 \xt Ex. 12:23; 2 Sam. 24:16; 1 Chr. 21:15; Ps. 78:49\x*the Destroyer.
\v 11 Now these things happened to them as an example, but \x + \xo 10:11 \xt See Rom. 4:23 \x*they were written down for our instruction, \x + \xo 10:11 \xt See Rom. 13:11\x*on whom the end of the ages has come.
\v 12 Therefore \x + \xo 10:12 \xt Rom. 11:20; [2 Pet. 3:17]\x*let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.
\v 13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. \x + \xo 10:13 \xt See ch. 1:9 \x*God is faithful, and \x + \xo 10:13 \xt [Dan. 3:17]; See 2 Pet. 2:9\x*he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
\p
\v 14 Therefore, my beloved, \x + \xo 10:14 \xt ver. 7\x*flee from idolatry.
\v 15 I speak \x + \xo 10:15 \xt [ch. 8:1]\x*as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
\v 16 \x + \xo 10:16 \xt ch. 11:25; Matt. 26:27, 28 \x*The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? \x + \xo 10:16 \xt ch. 11:23, 24; Matt. 26:26; See Acts 2:42; 20:7\x*The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?
\v 17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are \x + \xo 10:17 \xt ch. 12:12, 13, 20; Rom. 12:5; Eph. 4:4, 16; Col. 3:15\x*one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
\v 18 Consider \x + \xo 10:18 \xt Rom. 1:3; 4:1; 9:5; 2 Cor. 11:18 \x*the people of Israel:\f + \fr 10:18 \ft Greek \fq Consider Israel according to the flesh\f* \x + \xo 10:18 \xt Lev. 3:3; 7:15; [Heb. 13:10]\x*are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
\v 19 What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that \x + \xo 10:19 \xt See ch. 8:4\x*an idol is anything?
\v 20 No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice \x + \xo 10:20 \xt Deut. 32:17\x*they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons.
\v 21 \x + \xo 10:21 \xt [2 Cor. 6:15, 16] \x*You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and \x + \xo 10:21 \xt [Deut. 32:38] \x*the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and \x + \xo 10:21 \xt [Isa. 65:11]\x*the table of demons.
\v 22 \x + \xo 10:22 \xt Deut. 32:21 \x*Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? \x + \xo 10:22 \xt Eccles. 6:10; Ezek. 22:14\x*Are we stronger than he?
\s1 Do All to the Glory of God
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 10:23 \xt ch. 6:12; See ch. 8:9\x*“All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up.
\v 24 \x + \xo 10:24 \xt ver. 33; ch. 13:5; Phil. 2:21; [ch. 9:23; 2 Cor. 12:14]; See Rom. 15:1\x*Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
\v 25 \x + \xo 10:25 \xt ch. 8:7\x*Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
\v 26 For \x + \xo 10:26 \xt Cited from Ps. 24:1; [Ex. 9:29; 19:5; Deut. 10:14; Job 41:11; Ps. 50:12]\x*“the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.”
\v 27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, \x + \xo 10:27 \xt Luke 10:8\x*eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
\v 28 But if someone says to you, “This has been offered in sacrifice,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience—
\v 29 I do not mean \x + \xo 10:29 \xt [ch. 8:9-12] \x*your conscience, but his. For \x + \xo 10:29 \xt [ch. 9:19; Rom. 14:16]\x*why should my liberty be determined by someone else’s conscience?
\v 30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that \x + \xo 10:30 \xt Rom. 14:6; 1 Tim. 4:3, 4\x*for which I give thanks?
\p
\v 31 So, whether you eat or drink, or \x + \xo 10:31 \xt Col. 3:17; 1 Pet. 4:11\x*whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
\v 32 \x + \xo 10:32 \xt ch. 8:13; Rom. 14:13; 2 Cor. 6:3 \x*Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to \x + \xo 10:32 \xt [ch. 11:16]; See Acts 20:28\x*the church of God,
\v 33 just as \x + \xo 10:33 \xt ch. 9:22; [Gal. 1:10] \x*I try to please everyone in everything I do, \x + \xo 10:33 \xt See ver. 24\x*not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
\c 11
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 11:1 \xt See ch. 4:16\x*Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
\s1 Head Coverings
\p
\v 2 Now I commend you \x + \xo 11:2 \xt [ch. 4:17; 1 Thess. 3:6] \x*because you remember me in everything and \x + \xo 11:2 \xt 2 Thess. 2:15; 3:6 \x*maintain the traditions \x + \xo 11:2 \xt [1 Thess. 4:1, 2]\x*even as I delivered them to you.
\v 3 But I want you to understand that \x + \xo 11:3 \xt Eph. 1:22; 4:15; 5:23; Col. 1:18 \x*the head of every man is Christ, \x + \xo 11:3 \xt See Gen. 3:16 \x*the head of a wife\f + \fr 11:3 \ft Greek \+tl gunē\+tl*. This term may refer to a \fq woman \ft or a \fq wife\ft , depending on the context\f* is her husband, and \x + \xo 11:3 \xt [ch. 3:23]\x*the head of Christ is God.
\v 4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head,
\v 5 but every wife\f + \fr 11:5 \ft In verses 5–13, the Greek word \+tl gunē\+tl* is translated \fq wife \ft in verses that deal with wearing a veil, a sign of being married in first-century culture\f* who prays or \x + \xo 11:5 \xt Luke 2:36; Acts 21:9; [ch. 14:34] \x*prophesies \x + \xo 11:5 \xt [Num. 5:18] \x*with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same \x + \xo 11:5 \xt Deut. 21:12\x*as if her head were shaven.
\v 6 For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head.
\v 7 For a man ought not to cover his head, since \x + \xo 11:7 \xt See Gen. 1:26 \x*he is the image and glory of God, but \x + \xo 11:7 \xt [Prov. 12:4]\x*woman is the glory of man.
\v 8 For \x + \xo 11:8 \xt Gen. 2:21-23; [1 Tim. 2:13]\x*man was not made from woman, but woman from man.
\v 9 Neither was man created for woman, but \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Gen. 2:18\x*woman for man.
\v 10 That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.\f + \fr 11:10 \ft Or \fq messengers\ft , that is, people sent to observe and report\f*
\v 11 Nevertheless, \x + \xo 11:11 \xt Gal. 3:28\x*in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman;
\v 12 for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And \x + \xo 11:12 \xt See Rom. 11:36\x*all things are from God.
\v 13 Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered?
\v 14 Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him,
\v 15 but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
\v 16 \x + \xo 11:16 \xt 1 Tim. 6:3, 4 \x*If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do \x + \xo 11:16 \xt 2 Thess. 1:4; [1 Thess. 2:14]; See ch. 7:17; 10:32\x*the churches of God.
\s1 The Lord’s Supper
\p
\v 17 But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
\v 18 For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, \x + \xo 11:18 \xt ch. 1:10-12; [ch. 3:3]\x*I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part,\f + \fr 11:18 \ft Or \fq I believe a certain report\f*
\v 19 for \x + \xo 11:19 \xt [Matt. 18:7; Luke 17:1; Acts 20:30; 1 Tim. 4:1; 2 Pet. 2:1] \x*there must be factions among you in order \x + \xo 11:19 \xt 1 John 2:19; [Deut. 13:3]\x*that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.
\v 20 When you come together, it is not the Lord’s supper that you eat.
\v 21 For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, \x + \xo 11:21 \xt [2 Pet. 2:13; Jude 12]\x*another gets drunk.
\v 22 What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise \x + \xo 11:22 \xt See Acts 20:28 \x*the church of God and \x + \xo 11:22 \xt [Prov. 17:5; James 2:6]\x*humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.
\p
\v 23 For \x + \xo 11:23 \xt ch. 15:3; Gal. 1:12 \x*I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that \x + \xo 11:23 \xt For ver. 23-25, see Matt. 26:26-28; Mark 14:22-24; Luke 22:19, 20\x*the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,
\v 24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, \wj “This is my body which is for\wj*\f + \fr 11:24 \ft Some manuscripts \fq broken for\f*\wj you. Do this in remembrance of me.”\wj*\f + \fr 11:24 \ft Or \fq as my memorial\ft ; also verse 25\f*
\v 25 In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, \wj “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”\wj*
\v 26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death \x + \xo 11:26 \xt See John 21:22\x*until he comes.
\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 11:27 \xt [Num. 9:10, 13] \x*Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord \x + \xo 11:27 \xt [John 13:27] \x*in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning \x + \xo 11:27 \xt John 6:51, 53-56\x*the body and blood of the Lord.
\v 28 \x + \xo 11:28 \xt [2 Cor. 13:5; Gal. 6:4]\x*Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
\v 29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
\v 30 That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some \x + \xo 11:30 \xt See Matt. 27:52\x*have died.\f + \fr 11:30 \ft Greek \fq have fallen asleep \ft (as in 15:6, 20)\f*
\v 31 \x + \xo 11:31 \xt See 1 John 1:9\x*But if we judged\f + \fr 11:31 \ft Or \fq discerned\f* ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
\v 32 But when we are judged by the Lord, \x + \xo 11:32 \xt See Prov. 3:11 \x*we are disciplined\f + \fr 11:32 \ft Or \fq when we are judged we are being disciplined by the Lord\f* so that we may not be \x + \xo 11:32 \xt Rom. 5:16\x*condemned along with the world.
\p
\v 33 So then, my brothers,\f + \fr 11:33 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* when you come together to eat, wait for\f + \fr 11:33 \ft Or \fq share with\f* one another—
\v 34 \x + \xo 11:34 \xt ver. 21 \x*if anyone is hungry, \x + \xo 11:34 \xt ver. 22 \x*let him eat at home—so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things \x + \xo 11:34 \xt ch. 7:17; Titus 1:5 \x*I will give directions \x + \xo 11:34 \xt See ch. 4:19\x*when I come.
\c 12
\s1 Spiritual Gifts
\p \v 1 Now \x + \xo 12:1 \xt ch. 14:1\x*concerning\f + \fr 12:1 \ft The expression \fq Now concerning \ft introduces a reply to a question in the Corinthians’ letter; see 7:1\f* spiritual gifts,\f + \fr 12:1 \ft Or \fq spiritual persons\f* brothers,\f + \fr 12:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* I do not want you to be uninformed.
\v 2 You know that \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Eph. 2:11, 12; [1 Pet. 4:3]; See ch. 6:11 \x*when you were pagans \x + \xo 12:2 \xt 1 Thess. 1:9 \x*you were led astray to \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Hab. 2:18, 19; [Ps. 115:5; Isa. 46:7; Jer. 10:5]\x*mute idols, however you were led.
\v 3 Therefore I want you to understand that \x + \xo 12:3 \xt 1 John 4:2, 3 \x*no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says “Jesus is \x + \xo 12:3 \xt See Rom. 9:3 \x*accursed!” and \x + \xo 12:3 \xt John 15:26; [Matt. 16:17]; See Rom. 10:9\x*no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except in the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 4 Now \x + \xo 12:4 \xt [Heb. 2:4]; See Rom. 12:6 \x*there are varieties of gifts, but \x + \xo 12:4 \xt Eph. 4:4-6\x*the same Spirit;
\v 5 and \x + \xo 12:5 \xt Rom. 12:7; [Eph. 4:11] \x*there are varieties of service, but \x + \xo 12:5 \xt [See ver. 4 above]\x*the same Lord;
\v 6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is \x + \xo 12:6 \xt [See ver. 4 above]\x*the same God who empowers them all in everyone.
\v 7 \x + \xo 12:7 \xt Eph. 4:7; [ch. 14:26; Rom. 12:3]\x*To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
\v 8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of \x + \xo 12:8 \xt ch. 2:6, 7 \x*wisdom, and to another the utterance of \x + \xo 12:8 \xt See ch. 1:5\x*knowledge according to the same Spirit,
\v 9 to another \x + \xo 12:9 \xt ch. 13:2; 2 Cor. 4:13 \x*faith by the same Spirit, to another \x + \xo 12:9 \xt ver. 28, 30\x*gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
\v 10 to another \x + \xo 12:10 \xt ver. 28, 29; [Gal. 3:5] \x*the working of miracles, to another \x + \xo 12:10 \xt ch. 13:2, 8; 14:1 \x*prophecy, to another \x + \xo 12:10 \xt [ch. 14:29; 1 John 4:1] \x*the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another \x + \xo 12:10 \xt See Mark 16:17 \x*various kinds of tongues, to another \x + \xo 12:10 \xt ver. 30; ch. 14:26\x*the interpretation of tongues.
\v 11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, \x + \xo 12:11 \xt [2 Cor. 10:13] \x*who apportions to each one individually \x + \xo 12:11 \xt Heb. 2:4\x*as he wills.
\s1 One Body with Many Members
\p
\v 12 For just as \x + \xo 12:12 \xt See ch. 10:17 \x*the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, \x + \xo 12:12 \xt ver. 27\x*so it is with Christ.
\v 13 For \x + \xo 12:13 \xt [Rom. 6:5; Eph. 2:18] \x*in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body—\x + \xo 12:13 \xt Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11; [Eph. 2:13-17] \x*Jews or Greeks, slaves\f + \fr 12:13 \ft Or \fq servants\ft ; Greek \fq bondservants\f* or free—and \x + \xo 12:13 \xt [John 7:37-39]\x*all were made to drink of one Spirit.
\p
\v 14 For the body does not consist of one member but of many.
\v 15 If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
\v 16 And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.
\v 17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?
\v 18 But as it is, \x + \xo 12:18 \xt ver. 28 \x*God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, \x + \xo 12:18 \xt ver. 11; [ch. 3:5; Rom. 12:3]\x*as he chose.
\v 19 If all were a single member, where would the body be?
\v 20 As it is, there are many parts,\f + \fr 12:20 \ft Or \fq members\ft ; also verse 22\f* yet one body.
\p
\v 21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
\v 22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
\v 23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
\v 24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,
\v 25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
\v 26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, \x + \xo 12:26 \xt Rom. 12:15\x*all rejoice together.
\p
\v 27 Now \x + \xo 12:27 \xt [Eph. 1:23; 4:12; 5:30; Col. 1:24] \x*you are the body of Christ and individually \x + \xo 12:27 \xt See Rom. 12:5\x*members of it.
\v 28 And \x + \xo 12:28 \xt ver. 18 \x*God has appointed in the church first \x + \xo 12:28 \xt Eph. 4:11 \x*apostles, second \x + \xo 12:28 \xt Eph. 2:20; 3:5 \x*prophets, third teachers, then \x + \xo 12:28 \xt ver. 10 \x*miracles, then \x + \xo 12:28 \xt ver. 9 \x*gifts of healing, \x + \xo 12:28 \xt [Acts 20:35] \x*helping, \x + \xo 12:28 \xt [Rom. 12:8; 1 Tim. 5:17; Heb. 13:7, 17, 24]\x*administrating, and \x + \xo 12:28 \xt ver. 10 \x*various kinds of tongues.
\v 29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
\v 30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
\v 31 But \x + \xo 12:31 \xt ch. 14:1, 39\x*earnestly desire the higher gifts.
\p And I will show you a still more excellent way.
\c 13
\s1 The Way of Love
\p \v 1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 And if I have \x + \xo 13:2 \xt [ch. 14:1, 39; Matt. 7:22]; See Acts 2:18 \x*prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, \x + \xo 13:2 \xt Matt. 17:20; Mark 11:23; [Luke 17:6]\x*so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
\v 3 \x + \xo 13:3 \xt [Matt. 6:2] \x*If I give away all I have, and \x + \xo 13:3 \xt Dan. 3:28\x*if I deliver up my body to be burned,\f + \fr 13:3 \ft Some manuscripts \fq deliver up my body \ft [to death] \fq that I may boast\f* but have not love, I gain nothing.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 13:4 \xt [Prov. 10:12; 17:9; 1 Thess. 5:14; 2 Tim. 2:10; 1 Pet. 4:8] \x*Love is patient and \x + \xo 13:4 \xt [2 Cor. 6:6; Gal. 5:22; Eph. 4:32; Col. 3:12] \x*kind; love \x + \xo 13:4 \xt Acts 7:9 \x*does not envy or boast; it \x + \xo 13:4 \xt See ch. 4:6\x*is not arrogant
\v 5 or rude. It \x + \xo 13:5 \xt See ch. 10:24 \x*does not insist on its own way; it \x + \xo 13:5 \xt [Rom. 4:6; 2 Cor. 5:19]\x*is not irritable or resentful;\f + \fr 13:5 \ft Greek \fq irritable and does not count up wrongdoing\f*
\v 6 it \x + \xo 13:6 \xt [Rom. 1:32; 2 Thess. 2:12] \x*does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but \x + \xo 13:6 \xt [2 John 4; 3 John 3, 4]\x*rejoices with the truth.
\v 7 \x + \xo 13:7 \xt ch. 9:12 \x*Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, \x + \xo 13:7 \xt [See ver. 4 above]\x*endures all things.
\p
\v 8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
\v 9 For \x + \xo 13:9 \xt [ch. 8:2]\x*we know in part and we prophesy in part,
\v 10 but \x + \xo 13:10 \xt [John 15:15]\x*when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
\v 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
\v 12 For \x + \xo 13:12 \xt James 1:23; [Num. 12:8; Job 36:26; 2 Cor. 3:18; 5:7] \x*now we see in a mirror dimly, but \x + \xo 13:12 \xt 1 John 3:2; See Matt. 5:8 \x*then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as \x + \xo 13:12 \xt See ch. 8:3\x*I have been fully known.
\p
\v 13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
\c 14
\s1 Prophecy and Tongues
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 16:14 \x*Pursue love, and \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 12:31 \x*earnestly desire the \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 12:1 \x*spiritual gifts, especially that you may \x + \xo 14:1 \xt See ch. 11:4; 13:2\x*prophesy.
\v 2 For \x + \xo 14:2 \xt ver. 18-23, 27, 28\x*one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.
\v 3 On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.
\v 4 The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
\v 5 Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but \x + \xo 14:5 \xt [Num. 11:29]\x*even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.
\p
\v 6 Now, brothers,\f + \fr 14:6 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 20, 26, 39\f* if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some \x + \xo 14:6 \xt ver. 26; Eph. 1:17 \x*revelation or knowledge or prophecy or \x + \xo 14:6 \xt ver. 26; Acts 2:42; Rom. 6:17\x*teaching?
\v 7 If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played?
\v 8 And \x + \xo 14:8 \xt [Num. 10:9; Isa. 58:1; Jer. 4:19; Ezek. 33:3-6; Joel 2:1]\x*if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?
\v 9 So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be \x + \xo 14:9 \xt [ch. 9:26]\x*speaking into the air.
\v 10 There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning,
\v 11 but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be \x + \xo 14:11 \xt See Acts 28:2\x*a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.
\v 12 So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.
\p
\v 13 Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
\v 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.
\v 15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; \x + \xo 14:15 \xt [Eph. 5:19; Col. 3:16; James 5:13] \x*I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will \x + \xo 14:15 \xt Ps. 47:7\x*sing with my mind also.
\v 16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider\f + \fr 14:16 \ft Or \fq of him that is without gifts\f* say \x + \xo 14:16 \xt 1 Chr. 16:36; Neh. 5:13; 8:6; Ps. 106:48; Jer. 11:5; 28:6; Rev. 5:14; 7:12; 19:4; [2 Cor. 1:20] \x*“Amen” to \x + \xo 14:16 \xt ch. 11:24\x*your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?
\v 17 For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
\v 18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
\v 19 Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
\p
\v 20 Brothers, \x + \xo 14:20 \xt Eph. 4:14; Heb. 5:12, 13 \x*do not be children in your thinking. \x + \xo 14:20 \xt [Ps. 131:2; Isa. 28:9; Rom. 16:19]; See Matt. 18:3 \x*Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be \x + \xo 14:20 \xt ch. 2:6\x*mature.
\v 21 \x + \xo 14:21 \xt See John 10:34 \x*In the Law it is written, \x + \xo 14:21 \xt Cited from Isa. 28:11, 12; [Deut. 28:49]\x*“By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord.”
\v 22 Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign\f + \fr 14:22 \ft Greek lacks \fq a sign\f* not for unbelievers but for believers.
\v 23 If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, \x + \xo 14:23 \xt [Acts 2:13]\x*will they not say that you are out of your minds?
\v 24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,
\v 25 \x + \xo 14:25 \xt [Heb. 4:12] \x*the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, \x + \xo 14:25 \xt Luke 17:16 \x*falling on his face, he will worship God and \x + \xo 14:25 \xt Isa. 45:14; Zech. 8:23\x*declare that God is really among you.
\s1 Orderly Worship
\p
\v 26 What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has \x + \xo 14:26 \xt Eph. 5:19 \x*a hymn, \x + \xo 14:26 \xt See ver. 6 \x*a lesson, \x + \xo 14:26 \xt See ver. 6 \x*a revelation, \x + \xo 14:26 \xt ver. 18 \x*a tongue, or \x + \xo 14:26 \xt ver. 5, 13, 27, 28; ch. 12:10, 30 \x*an interpretation. \x + \xo 14:26 \xt 2 Cor. 12:19; 13:10; [ch. 12:7]\x*Let all things be done for building up.
\v 27 If any speak in \x + \xo 14:27 \xt [See ver. 26 above]\x*a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret.
\v 28 But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God.
\v 29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others \x + \xo 14:29 \xt [ch. 12:10; Job 12:11; 1 John 4:1]\x*weigh what is said.
\v 30 If a revelation is made to another sitting there, \x + \xo 14:30 \xt [1 Thess. 5:19, 20]\x*let the first be silent.
\v 31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged,
\v 32 and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
\v 33 For God is not a God of \x + \xo 14:33 \xt [ver. 40] \x*confusion but of peace.
\p As in \x + \xo 14:33 \xt See ch. 7:17\x*all the churches of the saints,
\v 34 \x + \xo 14:34 \xt [1 Tim. 2:11, 12] \x*the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but \x + \xo 14:34 \xt See 1 Pet. 3:1 \x*should be in submission, as \x + \xo 14:34 \xt [ver. 21]\x*the Law also says.
\v 35 If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.
\p
\v 36 Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
\v 37 \x + \xo 14:37 \xt [2 Cor. 10:7; 1 John 4:6]\x*If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
\v 38 If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.
\v 39 So, my brothers, \x + \xo 14:39 \xt ch. 12:31\x*earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
\v 40 \x + \xo 14:40 \xt [ver. 31, 33] \x*But all things should be done decently and \x + \xo 14:40 \xt Col. 2:5\x*in order.
\c 15
\s1 The Resurrection of Christ
\p \v 1 Now I would remind you, brothers,\f + \fr 15:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 6, 31, 50, 58\f* of the gospel \x + \xo 15:1 \xt [2 Tim. 2:8]; See ch. 3:6 \x*I preached to you, which you received, \x + \xo 15:1 \xt Rom. 5:2; [2 Cor. 1:24; 1 Pet. 5:12]\x*in which you stand,
\v 2 and by which \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 1:18 \x*you are being saved, if you \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 11:2; [Heb. 3:6, 14] \x*hold fast to the word I preached to you—\x + \xo 15:2 \xt Gal. 3:4\x*unless you believed in vain.
\p
\v 3 For \x + \xo 15:3 \xt ch. 11:23; Gal. 1:12 \x*I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died \x + \xo 15:3 \xt John 1:29; Gal. 1:4; Heb. 5:1, 3; 1 Pet. 2:24 \x*for our sins \x + \xo 15:3 \xt Isa. 53; Dan. 9:26; Zech. 13:7; [1 Pet. 1:11]\x*in accordance with the Scriptures,
\v 4 that he was buried, that he was raised \x + \xo 15:4 \xt [Hos. 6:2; Matt. 12:40; John 2:22] \x*on the third day \x + \xo 15:4 \xt Ps. 16:10; Isa. 53:10; [Acts 2:25-32; 13:33-35; 26:22, 23]\x*in accordance with the Scriptures,
\v 5 and that \x + \xo 15:5 \xt Luke 24:34 \x*he appeared to Cephas, then \x + \xo 15:5 \xt Mark 16:14; Luke 24:36; John 20:19, 26; Acts 10:41\x*to the twelve.
\v 6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
\v 7 Then he appeared to \x + \xo 15:7 \xt See Acts 12:17 \x*James, then \x + \xo 15:7 \xt Luke 24:50; Acts 1:3, 4\x*to all the apostles.
\v 8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, \x + \xo 15:8 \xt See ch. 9:1\x*he appeared also to me.
\v 9 For \x + \xo 15:9 \xt 2 Cor. 12:11; Eph. 3:7, 8; 1 Tim. 1:13-16 \x*I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because \x + \xo 15:9 \xt See Acts 8:3\x*I persecuted the church of God.
\v 10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, \x + \xo 15:10 \xt 2 Cor. 11:23; 12:11; Col. 1:29 \x*I worked harder than any of them, \x + \xo 15:10 \xt [ch. 3:6; 2 Cor. 3:5; Phil. 2:13]; See Matt. 10:20\x*though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
\v 11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
\s1 The Resurrection of the Dead
\p
\v 12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, \x + \xo 15:12 \xt [Acts 23:8; 2 Tim. 2:18]\x*how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
\v 13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, \x + \xo 15:13 \xt 1 Thess. 4:14\x*then not even Christ has been raised.
\v 14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.
\v 15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that \x + \xo 15:15 \xt See Acts 2:24\x*he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.
\v 16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
\v 17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and \x + \xo 15:17 \xt See Rom. 4:25\x*you are still in your sins.
\v 18 Then those also who \x + \xo 15:18 \xt 1 Thess. 4:16; Rev. 14:13\x*have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
\v 19 If in Christ we have hope\f + \fr 15:19 \ft Or \fq we have hoped\f* in this life only, \x + \xo 15:19 \xt [ch. 4:9; 2 Tim. 3:12]\x*we are of all people most to be pitied.
\p
\v 20 But in fact \x + \xo 15:20 \xt 2 Tim. 2:8; 1 Pet. 1:3 \x*Christ has been raised from the dead, \x + \xo 15:20 \xt ver. 23; See Acts 26:23\x*the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
\v 21 For as \x + \xo 15:21 \xt See Rom. 5:12 \x*by a man came death, \x + \xo 15:21 \xt John 11:25; Rom. 6:23\x*by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.
\v 22 For \x + \xo 15:22 \xt [Rom. 5:14-18]\x*as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
\v 23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then \x + \xo 15:23 \xt See 1 Thess. 2:19 \x*at his coming \x + \xo 15:23 \xt ver. 52; 1 Thess. 4:16; See Luke 14:14\x*those who belong to Christ.
\v 24 Then comes the end, when he delivers \x + \xo 15:24 \xt [Dan. 7:14, 27] \x*the kingdom to God the Father after destroying \x + \xo 15:24 \xt Eph. 1:21\x*every rule and every authority and power.
\v 25 For he must reign \x + \xo 15:25 \xt See Ps. 110:1\x*until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
\v 26 The last enemy to be \x + \xo 15:26 \xt 2 Tim. 1:10; [Rev. 20:14; 21:4]\x*destroyed is death.
\v 27 For \x + \xo 15:27 \xt Eph. 1:22; Cited from Ps. 8:6; See Matt. 11:27; 28:18\x*“God\f + \fr 15:27 \ft Greek \fq he\f* has put all things in subjection under his feet.” But when it says, “all things are put in subjection,” it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.
\v 28 When \x + \xo 15:28 \xt Phil. 3:21 \x*all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that \x + \xo 15:28 \xt [ch. 3:23; 11:3]\x*God may be all in all.
\p
\v 29 Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?
\v 30 Why are we \x + \xo 15:30 \xt 2 Cor. 11:26\x*in danger every hour?
\v 31 I protest, brothers, by \x + \xo 15:31 \xt 1 Thess. 2:19 \x*my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, \x + \xo 15:31 \xt Luke 9:23; See Rom. 8:36\x*I die every day!
\v 32 What do I gain if, humanly speaking, \x + \xo 15:32 \xt [2 Cor. 1:8] \x*I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, \x + \xo 15:32 \xt Cited from Isa. 22:13; [Isa. 56:12; Luke 12:19]\x*“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”
\v 33 \x + \xo 15:33 \xt James 1:16 \x*Do not be deceived: \x + \xo 15:33 \xt [ch. 5:6]\x*“Bad company ruins good morals.”\f + \fr 15:33 \ft Probably from Menander’s comedy \fq Thais\f*
\v 34 \x + \xo 15:34 \xt See Rom. 13:11 \x*Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For \x + \xo 15:34 \xt 1 Thess. 4:5 \x*some have no knowledge of God. \x + \xo 15:34 \xt ch. 6:5; [ch. 4:14]\x*I say this to your shame.
\s1 The Resurrection Body
\p
\v 35 But someone will ask, \x + \xo 15:35 \xt [Ezek. 37:3]\x*“How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?”
\v 36 You foolish person! \x + \xo 15:36 \xt John 12:24\x*What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
\v 37 And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
\v 38 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.
\v 39 For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
\v 40 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another.
\v 41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
\p
\v 42 \x + \xo 15:42 \xt Dan. 12:3; [Matt. 13:43]\x*So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable.
\v 43 It is sown in dishonor; \x + \xo 15:43 \xt Phil. 3:21; Col. 3:4\x*it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
\v 44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
\v 45 Thus it is written, \x + \xo 15:45 \xt Cited from Gen. 2:7 \x*“The first man Adam became a living being”;\f + \fr 15:45 \ft Greek \fq a living soul\f* \x + \xo 15:45 \xt Rom. 5:14 \x*the last Adam became a \x + \xo 15:45 \xt John 5:21; [John 6:33, 39, 40, 54, 57; Rom. 8:2, 10]\x*life-giving spirit.
\v 46 But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual.
\v 47 \x + \xo 15:47 \xt John 3:31 \x*The first man was from the earth, \x + \xo 15:47 \xt [Gen. 2:7; 3:19] \x*a man of dust; \x + \xo 15:47 \xt John 3:13, 31\x*the second man is from heaven.
\v 48 As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, \x + \xo 15:48 \xt [Phil. 3:20]\x*so also are those who are of heaven.
\v 49 Just \x + \xo 15:49 \xt Gen. 5:3 \x*as we have borne the image of the man of dust, \x + \xo 15:49 \xt See Rom. 8:29\x*we shall\f + \fr 15:49 \ft Some manuscripts \fq let us\f* also bear the image of the man of heaven.
\s1 Mystery and Victory
\p
\v 50 I tell you this, brothers: \x + \xo 15:50 \xt See Matt. 16:17 \x*flesh and blood \x + \xo 15:50 \xt [John 3:3, 5]\x*cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
\v 51 Behold! I tell you a mystery. \x + \xo 15:51 \xt 1 Thess. 4:15, 17 \x*We shall not all sleep, \x + \xo 15:51 \xt Phil. 3:21\x*but we shall all be changed,
\v 52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For \x + \xo 15:52 \xt Matt. 24:31; 1 Thess. 4:16; [Isa. 27:13; Zech. 9:14] \x*the trumpet will sound, and \x + \xo 15:52 \xt John 5:25, 28; [Luke 20:36]\x*the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.
\v 53 For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and \x + \xo 15:53 \xt [2 Cor. 5:2-4]\x*this mortal body must put on immortality.
\v 54 When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written:
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 15:54 \xt Cited from Isa. 25:8; [Heb. 2:14, 15; Rev. 20:14; 21:4]\x*“Death is swallowed up in victory.”
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 15:55 \xt Hos. 13:14\x*“O death, where is your victory?
\q2 O death, where is your sting?”
\b
\m
\v 56 The sting of death is sin, and \x + \xo 15:56 \xt Rom. 4:15; 5:13; 7:5, 8, 13\x*the power of sin is the law.
\v 57 But thanks be to God, \x + \xo 15:57 \xt [Rom. 8:37; 1 John 5:4]\x*who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 58 \x + \xo 15:58 \xt 2 Pet. 3:14 \x*Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in \x + \xo 15:58 \xt ch. 16:10; Jer. 48:10; John 6:28 \x*the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord \x + \xo 15:58 \xt [Gal. 6:9]; See ch. 3:8\x*your labor is not in vain.

\s1 The Collection for the Saints
\p
\v 1 Now concerning\f + \fr 16:1 \ft The expression \fq Now concerning \ft introduces a reply to a question in the Corinthians’ letter; see 7:1; also verse 12\f* \x + \xo 16:1 \xt See Acts 24:17\x*the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.
\v 2 On \x + \xo 16:2 \xt Acts 20:7; [Rev. 1:10] \x*the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, \x + \xo 16:2 \xt 2 Cor. 8:3, 11 \x*as he may prosper, \x + \xo 16:2 \xt 2 Cor. 9:3\x*so that there will be no collecting when I come.
\v 3 And when I arrive, I will send \x + \xo 16:3 \xt [2 Cor. 8:18, 19]\x*those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
\v 4 If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
\s1 Plans for Travel
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 16:5 \xt See ch. 4:19 \x*I will visit you after passing through \x + \xo 16:5 \xt See Acts 16:9 \x*Macedonia, for \x + \xo 16:5 \xt Acts 19:21\x*I intend to pass through Macedonia,
\v 6 and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may \x + \xo 16:6 \xt ver. 11; See Acts 15:3\x*help me on my journey, wherever I go.
\v 7 For I do not want to see you now \x + \xo 16:7 \xt [2 Cor. 1:15, 16] \x*just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, \x + \xo 16:7 \xt ch. 4:19; Acts 18:21; James 4:15\x*if the Lord permits.
\v 8 But I will stay in Ephesus until \x + \xo 16:8 \xt See Acts 2:1\x*Pentecost,
\v 9 for \x + \xo 16:9 \xt See Acts 14:27 \x*a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and \x + \xo 16:9 \xt Acts 19:9\x*there are many adversaries.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 16:10 \xt ch. 4:17; [2 Cor. 1:1] \x*When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for \x + \xo 16:10 \xt Rom. 16:21; 1 Thess. 3:2; [Phil. 2:20, 22] \x*he is doing \x + \xo 16:10 \xt See ch. 15:58\x*the work of the Lord, as I am.
\v 11 So \x + \xo 16:11 \xt 1 Tim. 4:12; [Titus 2:15] \x*let no one despise him. \x + \xo 16:11 \xt ver. 6 \x*Help him on his way \x + \xo 16:11 \xt Acts 15:33\x*in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
\s1 Final Instructions
\p
\v 12 Now concerning \x + \xo 16:12 \xt See Acts 18:24\x*our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will\f + \fr 16:12 \ft Or \fq God’s will for him\f* to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 16:13 \xt See Matt. 24:42 \x*Be watchful, \x + \xo 16:13 \xt Gal. 5:1; Phil. 1:27; 4:1; 1 Thess. 3:8; 2 Thess. 2:15; See ch. 15:1 \x*stand firm in the faith, \x + \xo 16:13 \xt 1 Sam. 4:9; 2 Sam. 10:12; Isa. 46:8 \x*act like men, \x + \xo 16:13 \xt Eph. 3:16; [Eph. 6:10; Col. 1:11]\x*be strong.
\v 14 \x + \xo 16:14 \xt ch. 14:1\x*Let all that you do be done in love.
\p
\v 15 Now I urge you, brothers\f + \fr 16:15 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verse 20\f*—you know that \x + \xo 16:15 \xt ch. 1:16 \x*the household\f + \fr 16:15 \ft Greek \fq house\f* of Stephanas were \x + \xo 16:15 \xt [Rom. 16:5] \x*the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves \x + \xo 16:15 \xt See Rom. 15:31\x*to the service of the saints—
\v 16 \x + \xo 16:16 \xt 1 Thess. 5:12; Heb. 13:17\x*be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.
\v 17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for \x + \xo 16:17 \xt Phil. 2:30; [2 Cor. 11:9; Philem. 13]\x*your absence,
\v 18 for they \x + \xo 16:18 \xt 2 Cor. 7:13; [Rom. 15:32; Philem. 7, 20] \x*refreshed my spirit as well as yours. \x + \xo 16:18 \xt Phil. 2:29; 1 Thess. 5:12\x*Give recognition to such people.
\s1 Greetings

\v 19 The churches of Asia send you greetings. \x + \xo 16:19 \xt See Acts 18:2 \x*Aquila and Prisca, together with \x + \xo 16:19 \xt See Rom. 16:5\x*the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord.
\v 20 All the brothers send you greetings. \x + \xo 16:20 \xt See Rom. 16:16\x*Greet one another with a holy kiss.
