\s1 The Command to Leave Horeb
\p \v 1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ch. 3:17 \x*the Arabah opposite \x + \xo 1:1 \xt [Num. 21:14] \x*Suph, between \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Sam. 25:1\x*Paran and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
\v 2 It is eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 2:14; 9:23; Num. 13:26; 32:8; 34:4\x*Kadesh-barnea.
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [Num. 33:38]\x*In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the \nd Lord\nd* had given him in commandment to them,
\v 4 after \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See Num. 21:21-32 \x*he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See Num. 21:33-35 \x*Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth and in \x + \xo 1:4 \xt ch. 3:1, 10; Josh. 12:4; 13:12\x*Edrei.
\v 5 Beyond the Jordan, \x + \xo 1:5 \xt ch. 29:1\x*in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying,
\v 6 “The \nd Lord\nd* our God said to us in Horeb, \x + \xo 1:6 \xt ch. 2:3; [Ex. 19:1; Num. 10:11]\x*‘You have stayed long enough at this mountain.
\v 7 Turn and take your journey, and go to \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [Num. 13:29] \x*the hill country of the Amorites and to all their neighbors in \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*the Arabah, \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Josh. 9:1\x*in the hill country and in the lowland and in the Negeb and \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Josh. 9:1\x*by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
\v 8 See, I have set the land before you. Go in and take possession of the land that the \nd Lord\nd* swore to your fathers, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Gen. 12:7; 13:14, 15; 15:18; 17:7, 8; 26:3, 4; 28:13, 14; 50:24\x*to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their offspring after them.’
\s1 Leaders Appointed
\p
\v 9 “At that time \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Num. 11:14; [Ex. 18:18]\x*I said to you, ‘I am not able to bear you by myself.
\v 10 The \nd Lord\nd* your God has multiplied you, and behold, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [ch. 10:22; 28:62]; See Gen. 15:5\x*you are today as numerous as the stars of heaven.
\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [2 Sam. 24:3] \x*May the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Gen. 12:2; 22:17; 26:3, 24\x*as he has promised you!
\v 12 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [1 Kgs. 3:8, 9]\x*How can I bear by myself the weight and burden of you and your strife?
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [Ex. 18:21; Num. 11:16, 17]\x*Choose for your tribes wise, understanding, and experienced men, and I will appoint them as your heads.’
\v 14 And you answered me, ‘The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.’
\v 15 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt Ex. 18:25\x*and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes.
\v 16 And I charged your judges at that time, ‘Hear the cases between your brothers, and \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 16:18; John 7:24\x*judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien who is with him.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 16:19; Ex. 23:2, 3; Lev. 19:15; 2 Chr. 19:7; Prov. 24:23; 28:21; Mal. 2:9; James 2:1, 9 \x*You shall not be partial in judgment. You shall hear the small and the great alike. You shall not be intimidated by anyone, for \x + \xo 1:17 \xt 2 Chr. 19:6; [Ex. 21:6] \x*the judgment is God’s. And the case that is too hard for you, you shall \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Ex. 18:22, 26\x*bring to me, and I will hear it.’
\v 18 And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.
\s1 Israel’s Refusal to Enter the Land
\p
\v 19 “Then we set out from Horeb and \x + \xo 1:19 \xt ch. 8:15; 32:10; Jer. 2:6; [Num. 10:12] \x*went through all that great and terrifying wilderness that you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the \nd Lord\nd* our God commanded us. And \x + \xo 1:19 \xt See ver. 2\x*we came to Kadesh-barnea.
\v 20 And I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the \nd Lord\nd* our God is giving us.
\v 21 See, the \nd Lord\nd* your God has set the land before you. Go up, take possession, as the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of your fathers, has told you. \x + \xo 1:21 \xt ch. 31:8; Josh. 1:9\x*Do not fear or be dismayed.’
\v 22 Then all of you came near me and said, ‘Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.’
\v 23 The thing seemed good to me, and \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Num. 13:3\x*I took twelve men from you, one man from each tribe.
\v 24 And \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See Num. 13:22-27\x*they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.
\v 25 And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again and said, ‘It is a good land that the \nd Lord\nd* our God is giving us.’
\p
\v 26 “Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the \nd Lord\nd* your God.
\v 27 And \x + \xo 1:27 \xt Ps. 106:25; See Num. 14:1-4 \x*you murmured in your tents and said, ‘Because the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 1:27 \xt ch. 9:28 \x*hated us he has brought us out of the land of Egypt, \x + \xo 1:27 \xt [Josh. 7:7]\x*to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.
\v 28 Where are we going up? \x + \xo 1:28 \xt Josh. 14:8 \x*Our brothers have made our hearts melt, saying, \x + \xo 1:28 \xt ch. 9:1, 2; See Num. 13:28-33 \x*“The people are greater and taller than we. The cities are great and fortified up to heaven. And besides, we have seen \x + \xo 1:28 \xt See Num. 13:22\x*the sons of the Anakim there.”’
\v 29 Then I said to you, ‘Do not be in dread or afraid of them.
\v 30 The \nd Lord\nd* your God who goes before you \x + \xo 1:30 \xt ch. 3:22; Ex. 14:14, 25; Josh. 10:14, 42; 23:3, 10; [Neh. 4:20]\x*will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,
\v 31 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the \nd Lord\nd* your God \x + \xo 1:31 \xt ch. 32:11, 12; Ex. 19:4; Isa. 46:3, 4; 63:9; Hos. 11:3\x*carried you, as a man carries his son, all the way that you went until you came to this place.’
\v 32 Yet in spite of this word \x + \xo 1:32 \xt Ps. 106:24; Jude 5\x*you did not believe the \nd Lord\nd* your God,
\v 33 \x + \xo 1:33 \xt See Ex. 13:21 \x*who went before you in the way \x + \xo 1:33 \xt Num. 10:33\x*to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night and in the cloud by day, to show you by what way you should go.
\s1 The Penalty for Israel’s Rebellion
\p
\v 34 “And the \nd Lord\nd* heard your words and was angered, and he swore,
\v 35 \x + \xo 1:35 \xt See ch. 2:15; Num. 14:20-30\x*‘Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land that I swore to give to your fathers,
\v 36 \x + \xo 1:36 \xt Num. 14:30; Josh. 14:9\x*except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the \nd Lord\nd*!’
\v 37 Even with me \x + \xo 1:37 \xt ch. 4:21; 32:51; 34:4; Num. 20:12; 27:13, 14; [Ps. 106:32]\x*the \nd Lord\nd* was angry on your account and said, ‘You also shall not go in there.
\v 38 \x + \xo 1:38 \xt ch. 31:3, 7; Ex. 24:13; [1 Sam. 16:22] \x*Joshua the son of Nun, \x + \xo 1:38 \xt ch. 31:3, 7; Ex. 24:13; [1 Sam. 16:22] \x*who stands before you, he shall enter. \x + \xo 1:38 \xt ch. 31:7, 23; Num. 27:18-20\x*Encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
\v 39 And as for \x + \xo 1:39 \xt Num. 14:3, 31 \x*your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who today \x + \xo 1:39 \xt Isa. 7:15, 16\x*have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there. And to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.
\v 40 But as for you, \x + \xo 1:40 \xt ch. 2:1; Num. 14:25\x*turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.’
\p
\v 41 “Then you answered me, \x + \xo 1:41 \xt Num. 14:40\x*‘We have sinned against the \nd Lord\nd*. We ourselves will go up and fight, just as the \nd Lord\nd* our God commanded us.’ And every one of you fastened on his weapons of war and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.
\v 42 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, \x + \xo 1:42 \xt Num. 14:42 \x*‘Say to them, Do not go up or fight, \x + \xo 1:42 \xt [ch. 31:17]\x*for I am not in your midst, lest you be defeated before your enemies.’
\v 43 So I spoke to you, and you would not listen; but you rebelled against the command of the \nd Lord\nd* and \x + \xo 1:43 \xt Num. 14:44\x*presumptuously went up into the hill country.
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44 \xt Num. 14:45 \x*Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you \x + \xo 1:44 \xt [Ps. 118:12; Isa. 7:18] \x*as bees do and beat you down in Seir as far as \x + \xo 1:44 \xt See Num. 21:3\x*Hormah.
\v 45 And you returned and wept before the \nd Lord\nd*, but the \nd Lord\nd* did not listen to your voice or give ear to you.
\v 46 So \x + \xo 1:46 \xt Num. 20:1, 22; Judg. 11:17\x*you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.
\c 2
\s1 The Wilderness Years
\p \v 1 “Then we turned and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ch. 1:40; Num. 14:25\x*as the \nd Lord\nd* told me. And for many days we traveled around Mount Seir.
\v 2 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
\v 3 ‘You have been traveling around this mountain country \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 1:6\x*long enough. Turn northward
\v 4 and command the people, “You are about to pass through the territory of \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ch. 23:7; Amos 1:11; Obad. 10, 12 \x*your brothers, the people of Esau, \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See Gen. 32:3 \x*who live in Seir; and \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See Num. 20:18-21\x*they will be afraid of you. So be very careful.
\v 5 Do not contend with them, for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [See ver. 4 above]\x*I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession.
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt ver. 28\x*You shall purchase food from them with money, that you may eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money, that you may drink.
\v 7 For the \nd Lord\nd* your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands. \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [Job 23:10] \x*He knows your going through this great wilderness. \x + \xo 2:7 \xt See ch. 8:2-4\x*These forty years the \nd Lord\nd* your God has been with you. You have lacked nothing.”’
\v 8 So \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Judg. 11:18 \x*we went on, away from our brothers, the people of Esau, who live in Seir, away from \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See ch. 1:1 \x*the Arabah road from \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 1 Kgs. 9:26; [2 Kgs. 14:22; 16:6; 2 Chr. 26:2] \x*Elath and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See Num. 33:35\x*Ezion-geber.
\p “And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.
\v 9 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ver. 19, 29 \x*‘Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ver. 18; Num. 21:15; Isa. 15:1 \x*Ar to \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ver. 19; Gen. 19:36, 37\x*the people of Lot for a possession.’
\v 10 (\x + \xo 2:10 \xt Gen. 14:5 \x*The Emim formerly lived there, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ver. 21] \x*a people great and many, and tall \x + \xo 2:10 \xt See Num. 13:22\x*as the Anakim.
\v 11 Like the Anakim they are also counted as \x + \xo 2:11 \xt See Gen. 14:5\x*Rephaim, but the Moabites call them Emim.
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ver. 22; Gen. 14:6; See Gen. 36:20-30 \x*The Horites also lived in Seir formerly, but the people of Esau dispossessed them and destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Num. 21:24, 31, 35\x*as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the \nd Lord\nd* gave to them.)
\v 13 ‘Now rise up and go over \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Num. 21:12]\x*the brook Zered.’ So we went over \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Num. 21:12]\x*the brook Zered.
\v 14 And the time from our leaving \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See ch. 1:2, 19 \x*Kadesh-barnea until we crossed \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Num. 21:12] \x*the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Num. 14:33, 35; 26:64; Ps. 78:33; 95:11; 106:26; Ezek. 20:15; [1 Cor. 10:5; Heb. 3:17]; See ch. 1:35\x*until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the \nd Lord\nd* had sworn to them.
\v 15 For indeed the hand of the \nd Lord\nd* was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.
\p
\v 16 “So as soon as all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people,
\v 17 the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
\v 18 ‘Today you are to cross the border of Moab at Ar.
\v 19 And when you approach the territory of the people of Ammon, \x + \xo 2:19 \xt [ver. 9] \x*do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the people of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to \x + \xo 2:19 \xt Gen. 19:36, 38\x*the sons of Lot for a possession.’
\v 20 (It is also counted as a land of \x + \xo 2:20 \xt See Gen. 14:5\x*Rephaim. Rephaim formerly lived there—but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim—
\v 21 \x + \xo 2:21 \xt [ver. 10]\x*a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the \nd Lord\nd* destroyed them before the Ammonites,\f + \fr 2:21 \ft Hebrew \fq them\f* and they dispossessed them and settled in their place,
\v 22 as he did for the people of Esau, who live in Seir, when he destroyed \x + \xo 2:22 \xt Gen. 14:6; See Gen. 36:20-30\x*the Horites before them and they dispossessed them and settled in their place even to this day.
\v 23 As for \x + \xo 2:23 \xt Josh. 13:3, 4 \x*the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as \x + \xo 2:23 \xt Gen. 10:19; Jer. 25:20 \x*Gaza, \x + \xo 2:23 \xt See Gen. 10:14\x*the Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their place.)
\v 24 ‘Rise up, set out on your journey and \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Num. 21:13, 14; Judg. 11:18, 21 \x*go over the Valley of the Arnon. Behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Num. 21:27, 28, 30 \x*Heshbon, and his land. Begin to take possession, and \x + \xo 2:24 \xt [ver. 9]\x*contend with him in battle.
\v 25 This day I will begin to put \x + \xo 2:25 \xt ch. 11:25; 28:10; See Ex. 15:14-16; Josh. 2:9-11\x*the dread and fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.’
\s1 The Defeat of King Sihon
\p
\v 26 “So I sent messengers from the wilderness of \x + \xo 2:26 \xt Josh. 13:18; 1 Chr. 6:79 \x*Kedemoth to Sihon the king of \x + \xo 2:26 \xt [See ver. 24 above] \x*Heshbon, \x + \xo 2:26 \xt [ch. 20:10]\x*with words of peace, saying,
\v 27 \x + \xo 2:27 \xt Num. 21:21, 22; Judg. 11:19\x*‘Let me pass through your land. I will go only by the road; I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.
\v 28 \x + \xo 2:28 \xt ver. 6; Num. 20:19\x*You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink. Only let me pass through on foot,
\v 29 \x + \xo 2:29 \xt ver. 5, 9; [ch. 23:3, 4; Num. 20:18; Judg. 11:17, 18]\x*as the sons of Esau who live in Seir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land that the \nd Lord\nd* our God is giving to us.’
\v 30 But \x + \xo 2:30 \xt Num. 21:23 \x*Sihon the king of \x + \xo 2:30 \xt [See ver. 24 above] \x*Heshbon would not let us pass by him, for the \nd Lord\nd* your God \x + \xo 2:30 \xt See Ex. 4:21\x*hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as he is this day.
\v 31 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, ‘Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you. Begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.’
\v 32 Then \x + \xo 2:32 \xt See Num. 21:23-30\x*Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.
\v 33 And \x + \xo 2:33 \xt [ch. 7:2] \x*the \nd Lord\nd* our God gave him over to us, and \x + \xo 2:33 \xt ch. 29:7\x*we defeated him and his sons and all his people.
\v 34 And we captured all his cities at that time and devoted to destruction\f + \fr 2:34 \ft That is, set apart (devoted) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction)\f* every \x + \xo 2:34 \xt ch. 3:6\x*city, men, women, and children. We left no survivors.
\v 35 Only the livestock we took as spoil for ourselves, with the plunder of the cities that we captured.
\v 36 \x + \xo 2:36 \xt ch. 3:12; 4:48; Josh. 12:2; 13:9, 16; 2 Kgs. 10:33 \x*From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Valley of the Arnon, and from \x + \xo 2:36 \xt Josh. 13:9, 16; 2 Sam. 24:5 \x*the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us. \x + \xo 2:36 \xt Ps. 44:3\x*The \nd Lord\nd* our God gave all into our hands.
\v 37 Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river \x + \xo 2:37 \xt ch. 3:16; Gen. 32:22; Num. 21:24; Josh. 12:2; Judg. 11:22\x*Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, whatever the \nd Lord\nd* our God had forbidden us.

\s1 The Defeat of King Og
\p \v 1 “Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan. And \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ch. 29:7; Num. 21:33, 35 \x*Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See ch. 1:4\x*Edrei.
\v 2 But the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand. And you shall do to him as you did to \x + \xo 3:2 \xt See Num. 21:23-26, 34\x*Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.’
\v 3 So the \nd Lord\nd* our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people, \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Num. 21:35\x*and we struck him down until he had no survivor left.
\v 4 And we took all his cities at that time—there was not a city that we did not take from them—sixty cities, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt 1 Kgs. 4:13\x*the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
\v 5 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.
\v 6 And \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See ch. 7:2; Ps. 135:10-12 \x*we devoted them to destruction,\f + \fr 3:6 \ft That is, set apart (devoted) as an offering to the Lord (for destruction); twice in this verse\f* as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, devoting to destruction every \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ch. 2:34\x*city, men, women, and children.
\v 7 But all the livestock and the spoil of the cities we took as our plunder.
\v 8 So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the Valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon

\p \v 1 So Moses continued to speak these words to all Israel.

\p
\v 7 Then \x + \xo 31:7 \xt [ch. 3:28] \x*Moses summoned Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, \x + \xo 31:7 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*“Be strong and courageous, for you shall go with this people into the land that the \nd Lord\nd* has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you shall put them in possession of it.

\s1 The Reading of the Law

\s1 Joshua Commissioned to Lead Israel
\p
\v 14 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses, \x + \xo 31:14 \xt [ch. 34:5; Num. 27:13] \x*“Behold, the days approach when you must die. Call Joshua and present yourselves in the tent of meeting, that \x + \xo 31:14 \xt [ver. 23; Num. 27:19]\x*I may commission him.” And Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.
\v 15 And \x + \xo 31:15 \xt Ex. 33:9; Num. 12:5\x*the \nd Lord\nd* appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud. And the pillar of cloud stood over the entrance of the tent.
\p
\v 16 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses, \x + \xo 31:16 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*“Behold, you are about to lie down with your fathers. Then this people will rise and \x + \xo 31:16 \xt Ex. 34:15, 16; Lev. 20:5; Num. 15:39 \x*whore after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering, and they will \x + \xo 31:16 \xt ch. 32:15; Judg. 2:12; 10:6, 13 \x*forsake me and \x + \xo 31:16 \xt Judg. 2:20\x*break my covenant that I have made with them.
\v 17 Then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and \x + \xo 31:17 \xt 2 Chr. 12:5; 15:2; 24:20 \x*I will forsake them and \x + \xo 31:17 \xt ch. 32:20; Ps. 30:7; 104:29; Isa. 8:17; 64:7; [Isa. 59:2] \x*hide my face from them, and they will be devoured. And many evils and troubles will come upon them, so that they will say in that day, \x + \xo 31:17 \xt Judg. 6:13 \x*‘Have not these evils come upon us because \x + \xo 31:17 \xt Num. 14:42\x*our God is not among us?’
\v 18 And I will surely hide my face in that day because of all the evil that they have done, because \x + \xo 31:18 \xt ver. 20\x*they have turned to other gods.
\p
\v 19 “Now therefore write \x + \xo 31:19 \xt See ch. 32:1-43 \x*this song and \x + \xo 31:19 \xt [2 Sam. 1:18] \x*teach it to the people of Israel. Put it in their mouths, that this song may be \x + \xo 31:19 \xt ver. 21, 26\x*a witness for me against the people of Israel.
\v 20 For when I have brought them into the land \x + \xo 31:20 \xt See Ex. 3:8 \x*flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to give to their fathers, and they have eaten and are full and \x + \xo 31:20 \xt ch. 32:15; Neh. 9:25, 26; Jer. 5:28; Hos. 13:6 \x*grown fat, \x + \xo 31:20 \xt ver. 18 \x*they will turn to other gods and serve them, and \x + \xo 31:20 \xt Num. 14:11, 23; 16:30 \x*despise me and \x + \xo 31:20 \xt [See ver. 16 above]\x*break my covenant.
\v 21 And when many evils and troubles have come upon them, this song shall confront them as \x + \xo 31:21 \xt ver. 19, 26 \x*a witness (for it will live unforgotten in the mouths of their offspring). For \x + \xo 31:21 \xt [Hos. 5:3; 13:5]\x*I know what they are inclined to do even today, before I have brought them into the land that I swore to give.”
\v 22 So Moses wrote this song the same day and taught it to the people of Israel.

\v 23 \x + \xo 31:23 \xt [ver. 14] \x*And the \nd Lord\nd*\f + \fr 31:23 \ft Hebrew \fq he\f* commissioned Joshua the son of Nun and said, \x + \xo 31:23 \xt See ver. 6 \x*“Be strong and courageous, for you shall bring the people of Israel into the land that I swore to give them. \x + \xo 31:23 \xt ver. 8; Josh. 1:5; 3:7\x*I will be with you.”
\p
\v 24 When Moses had finished \x + \xo 31:24 \xt ver. 9\x*writing the words of this law in a book to the very end,

\s1 The Song of Moses

\v 30 Then Moses spoke the words of this song until they were finished, in the ears of all the assembly of Israel:

\v 7 \x + \xo 34:7 \xt ch. 31:2 \x*Moses was 120 years old when he died. \x + \xo 34:7 \xt [Gen. 27:1; 48:10; Josh. 14:10, 11; 1 Sam. 3:2; 4:15]\x*His eye was undimmed, and his vigor unabated.
\v 8 And the people of Israel \x + \xo 34:8 \xt Num. 20:29; [Gen. 50:3]\x*wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days. Then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.
