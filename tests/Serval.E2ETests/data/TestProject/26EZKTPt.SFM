\s1 Ezekiel in Babylon
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 1:1 \xt [ver. 3; Num. 4:3] \x*In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ch. 3:15, 23; 10:15, 20, 22; 43:3 \x*the Chebar canal, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt [Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:21; John 1:51; Acts 7:56; 10:11; Rev. 19:11] \x*the heavens were opened, and I saw \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ch. 8:3; 40:2; [ch. 11:24; Num. 12:6]\x*visions of God.\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or \fq from God\f*
\v 2 On the fifth day of the month (it was \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [ch. 8:1]; See ch. 20:1 \x*the fifth year of \x + \xo 1:2 \xt 2 Kgs. 24:12, 15; [ch. 17:12; 19:8; 33:21; 40:1]\x*the exile of King Jehoiachin),
\v 3 the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Ezekiel \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [ver. 1] \x*the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*the Chebar canal, and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ch. 3:22; 8:1; 33:22; 37:1; 40:1; [1 Kgs. 18:46; 2 Kgs. 3:15]\x*the hand of the \nd Lord\nd* was upon him there.

\p
\v 4 As I looked, behold, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Jer. 23:19; 25:32; 30:23; [ch. 3:12] \x*a stormy wind came \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See Jer. 1:14 \x*out of the north, and a great cloud, with \x + \xo 1:4 \xt ver. 27 \x*brightness around it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt ver. 27; ch. 8:2\x*as it were gleaming metal.\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or \fq amber\ft ; also verse 27\f*
\v 5 And from the midst of it came the likeness of \x + \xo 1:5 \xt See Rev. 4:6-8 \x*four living creatures. \x + \xo 1:5 \xt ch. 10:14, 21\x*And this was their appearance: they had a human likeness,
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt ch. 10:21\x*but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.
\v 7 Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf’s foot. And they sparkled \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ch. 40:3; Rev. 1:15; 2:18\x*like burnished bronze.
\v 8 Under their wings \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ver. 17; ch. 10:11 \x*on their four sides \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ch. 10:8, 21\x*they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:
\v 9 their wings touched one another. \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ch. 10:22 \x*Each one of them went straight forward, \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [See ver. 8 above]\x*without turning as they went.
\v 10 As for the likeness of their faces, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 10:14, 21\x*each had a human face. The four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle.
\v 11 Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above. Each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ver. 23; [Isa. 6:2]\x*two covered their bodies.
\v 12 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*And each went straight forward. \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ch. 10:17\x*Wherever the spirit\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Or \fq Spirit\ft ; also twice in verse 20 and once in verse 21\f* would go, they went, without turning as they went.
\v 13 As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [Ps. 104:4] \x*like burning coals of fire, \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [Ps. 104:4] \x*like the appearance of torches moving to and fro among the living creatures. \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [Ps. 97:3, 4]\x*And the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.
\v 14 And the living creatures \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [Zech. 4:10] \x*darted to and fro, \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [Matt. 24:27; Luke 17:24]\x*like the appearance of a flash of lightning.
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt ch. 10:9; [Dan. 7:9]\x*Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Hebrew \fq of their faces\f*
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt [See ver. 15 above] \x*As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like \x + \xo 1:16 \xt [Dan. 10:6] \x*the gleaming of beryl. \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 10:10\x*And the four had the same likeness, their appearance and construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 10:11 \x*When they went, they went \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ver. 8 \x*in any of their four directions\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Hebrew \fq on their four sides\f* \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ver. 9\x*without turning as they went.
\v 18 And their rims were tall and awesome, \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ch. 10:12; [Rev. 4:8]\x*and the rims of all four were full of eyes all around.
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19 \xt ch. 10:16 \x*And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; \x + \xo 1:19 \xt [ch. 10:19; 11:22]\x*and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20 \xt ch. 10:17\x*Wherever the spirit wanted to go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them, \x + \xo 1:20 \xt ch. 10:17\x*for the spirit of the living creatures\f + \fr 1:20 \ft Or \fq the spirit of life\ft ; also verse 21\f* was in the wheels.
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [See ver. 19 above] \x*When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [See ver. 19 above] \x*and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them, \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [See ver. 20 above]\x*for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
\p
\v 22 Over the heads of the living creatures there was \x + \xo 1:22 \xt [ver. 25, 26; ch. 10:1] \x*the likeness of an expanse, shining like awe-inspiring \x + \xo 1:22 \xt [Rev. 4:6]\x*crystal, spread out above their heads.
\v 23 And under the expanse their wings were \x + \xo 1:23 \xt ver. 7 \x*stretched out straight, one toward another. \x + \xo 1:23 \xt ver. 11\x*And each creature had two wings covering its body.
\v 24 And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings \x + \xo 1:24 \xt ch. 43:2; [Rev. 1:15] \x*like the sound of many waters, like \x + \xo 1:24 \xt Ps. 29:3, 4; 68:33 \x*the sound of the \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See Gen. 17:1 \x*Almighty, a sound of tumult \x + \xo 1:24 \xt Dan. 10:6; [Rev. 19:6]\x*like the sound of an army. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
\v 25 And there came a voice from above \x + \xo 1:25 \xt [ver. 22]\x*the expanse over their heads. When they stood still, they let down their wings.
\p
\v 26 And above the expanse over their heads there was \x + \xo 1:26 \xt ch. 10:1; [1 Kgs. 22:19] \x*the likeness of a throne, \x + \xo 1:26 \xt ch. 10:1; [1 Kgs. 22:19] \x*in appearance \x + \xo 1:26 \xt Ex. 24:10 \x*like sapphire;\f + \fr 1:26 \ft Or \fq lapis lazuli\f* and seated above the likeness of a throne was \x + \xo 1:26 \xt Dan. 8:15; [Rev. 1:13]\x*a likeness with a human appearance.
\v 27 And \x + \xo 1:27 \xt ch. 8:2; [ver. 4] \x*upward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were \x + \xo 1:27 \xt See ver. 4 \x*gleaming metal, like the appearance of fire enclosed all around. And downward from what had the appearance of his waist I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and \x + \xo 1:27 \xt ver. 4\x*there was brightness around him.\f + \fr 1:27 \ft Or \fq it\f*
\v 28 Like the appearance of \x + \xo 1:28 \xt Gen. 9:13; [Rev. 4:3; 10:1] \x*the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around.
\p Such was the appearance of the likeness of \x + \xo 1:28 \xt ch. 3:23; 8:4; 9:3; 10:4, 18, 19; 11:22, 23; 43:4, 5; 44:4; [Ex. 24:16] \x*the glory of the \nd Lord\nd*. And when I saw it, \x + \xo 1:28 \xt ch. 3:23; 43:3; 44:4; [Gen. 17:3, 17; Josh. 5:14; Dan. 8:17; Acts 9:4; Rev. 1:17]\x*I fell on my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.

\s1 Ezekiel’s Call
\p \v 1 And he said to me, \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ch. 3:1, 3, 4, 17, 25; 4:1, 16; 5:1 \x*“Son of man,\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or \fq Son of Adam\ft ; so throughout Ezekiel\f* \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Dan. 10:11\x*stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.”
\v 2 And as he spoke to me, \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 3:24 \x*the Spirit entered into me and \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 3:24; Dan. 8:18\x*set me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.
\v 3 And he said to me, “Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [ver. 5, 6, 8; ch. 3:26; 24:3; 44:6] \x*nations of rebels, who have rebelled against me. \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 20:16, 18, 21\x*They and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.
\v 4 The descendants also are \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [ch. 3:7]\x*impudent and stubborn: I send you to them, and you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the Lord \nd God\nd*.’
\v 5 And \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ch. 3:11; [ch. 3:27; 17:12] \x*whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*a rebellious house) \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ch. 33:33\x*they will know that a prophet has been among them.
\v 6 And you, son of man, \x + \xo 2:6 \xt ch. 3:9; Jer. 1:8 \x*be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [ch. 28:24; 2 Sam. 23:6; Mic. 7:4] \x*though briers and thorns are with you and you sit on \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Deut. 8:15]\x*scorpions.\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Or \fq on scorpion plants\f* Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.
\v 7 And you shall speak my words to them, \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [See ver. 5 above]\x*whether they hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house.
\p
\v 8 “But you, son of man, hear what I say to you. \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [Isa. 50:5] \x*Be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Rev. 10:9; [ch. 3:1, 3]\x*eat what I give you.”
\v 9 And when I looked, behold, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ch. 8:3; Dan. 10:10; Rev. 10:2 \x*a hand was stretched out to me, and behold, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Jer. 36:2\x*a scroll of a book was in it.
\v 10 And he spread it before me. And it had writing \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Rev. 5:1\x*on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.
\c 3
\p \v 1 And he said to me, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [See ch. 2:1 above] \x*“Son of man, eat whatever you find here. \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [ch. 2:8]\x*Eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.”
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me this scroll to eat.
\v 3 And he said to me, “Son of man, feed your belly with this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it.” \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Jer. 15:16; Rev. 10:9, 10 \x*Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth \x + \xo 3:3 \xt [Ps. 19:10; 119:103]\x*as sweet as honey.
\p
\v 4 And he said to me, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See ch. 2:1\x*“Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with my words to them.
\v 5 For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel—
\v 6 not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [Matt. 11:21, 23]\x*Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you.
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [John 15:20] \x*But the house of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, for they are not willing to listen to me: because all the house of Israel \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [ch. 2:4]\x*have a hard forehead and a stubborn heart.
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Jer. 1:18\x*Behold, I have made your face as hard as their faces, and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
\v 9 Like \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [Isa. 50:7] \x*emery harder than flint have I made your forehead. \x + \xo 3:9 \xt ch. 2:6\x*Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.”
\v 10 Moreover, he said to me, “Son of man, \x + \xo 3:10 \xt Jer. 26:2 \x*all my words that I shall speak to you receive \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [ver. 3]\x*in your heart, and hear with your ears.
\v 11 And go to the exiles, \x + \xo 3:11 \xt ch. 33:2, 12, 17, 30 \x*to your people, and speak to them and say to them, \x + \xo 3:11 \xt ver. 27 \x*‘Thus says the Lord \nd God\nd*,’ \x + \xo 3:11 \xt ch. 2:7\x*whether they hear or refuse to hear.”
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12 \xt ch. 8:3; 11:1, 24; 43:5; [ch. 37:1] \x*Then the Spirit\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Or \fq the wind\ft ; also verse 14\f* lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Or \fq sound\f* of \x + \xo 3:12 \xt [ch. 1:24]\x*a great earthquake: “Blessed be the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* from its place!”
\v 13 It was the sound of the wings of \x + \xo 3:13 \xt ch. 1:5, 15 \x*the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, and the sound of \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [ch. 1:24]\x*a great earthquake.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14 \xt ch. 8:3; 11:1, 24; 43:5; [ch. 37:1] \x*The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the \x + \xo 3:14 \xt See ch. 1:3\x*hand of the \nd Lord\nd* being strong upon me.
\v 15 \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See ch. 1:1 \x*And I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were dwelling \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See ch. 1:1 \x*by the Chebar canal, and I sat where they were dwelling.\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Or \fq Chebar, and to where they dwelt\f* And \x + \xo 3:15 \xt Job 2:13; Ps. 137:1; Lam. 2:10 \x*I sat there \x + \xo 3:15 \xt ch. 4:17; Isa. 52:14; Jer. 14:9 \x*overwhelmed among them \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [Gen. 50:10; 1 Sam. 31:13]\x*seven days.
\s1 A Watchman for Israel
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 3:16 \xt [Jer. 42:7]\x*And at the end of seven days, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me:
\v 17 \x + \xo 3:17 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*“Son of man, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt ch. 33:7; Isa. 52:8; 56:10; Jer. 6:17; [Heb. 13:17] \x*I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel. Whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall \x + \xo 3:17 \xt 2 Chr. 19:10; [2 Kgs. 6:10]; See ver. 18-21; ch. 33:4-6\x*give them warning from me.
\v 18 \x + \xo 3:18 \xt ch. 33:8 \x*If I say to the wicked, \x + \xo 3:18 \xt Gen. 2:17 \x*‘You shall surely die,’ \x + \xo 3:18 \xt [See ver. 17 above] \x*and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked person \x + \xo 3:18 \xt ch. 18:18; Jer. 31:30; [John 8:21, 24] \x*shall die for\f + \fr 3:18 \ft Or \fq in\ft ; also verses 19, 20\f* his iniquity, \x + \xo 3:18 \xt ver. 20; ch. 33:6, 8; 34:10; [ch. 18:13; Acts 18:6; 20:26]\x*but his blood I will require at your hand.
\v 19 \x + \xo 3:19 \xt ch. 33:9 \x*But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity, \x + \xo 3:19 \xt [1 Tim. 4:16] \x*but you \x + \xo 3:19 \xt ch. 14:14, 20\x*will have delivered your soul.
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20 \xt See ch. 18:24 \x*Again, if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and commits injustice, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Jer. 6:21 \x*and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. \x + \xo 3:20 \xt [See ver. 17 above] \x*Because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt See ch. 18:24 \x*and his righteous deeds that he has done shall not be remembered, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt [See ver. 18 above]\x*but his blood I will require at your hand.
\v 21 But if you warn the righteous person not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and you will have delivered your soul.”
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22 \xt See ch. 1:3 \x*And the hand of the \nd Lord\nd* was upon me there. And he said to me, “Arise, go out into \x + \xo 3:22 \xt ch. 8:4; 37:1; Gen. 11:2 \x*the valley,\f + \fr 3:22 \ft Or \fq plain\ft ; also verse 23\f* and \x + \xo 3:22 \xt [Acts 9:6; 22:10]\x*there I will speak with you.”
\v 23 So I arose and went out into the valley, and behold, \x + \xo 3:23 \xt See ch. 1:28 \x*the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* stood there, like the glory that I had seen \x + \xo 3:23 \xt See ch. 1:1\x*by the Chebar canal, \x + \xo 3:23 \xt See ch. 1:28 \x*and I fell on my face.
\v 24 \x + \xo 3:24 \xt See ch. 2:2\x*But the Spirit entered into me and set me on my feet, and he spoke with me and said to me, “Go, shut yourself within your house.
\v 25 And you, O son of man, behold, \x + \xo 3:25 \xt ch. 4:8\x*cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people.
\v 26 And I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, so that \x + \xo 3:26 \xt [Isa. 8:16] \x*you shall be mute and unable to reprove them, \x + \xo 3:26 \xt [ch. 2:3]\x*for they are a rebellious house.
\v 27 \x + \xo 3:27 \xt [ch. 24:27; 29:21] \x*But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, \x + \xo 3:27 \xt ver. 11 \x*‘Thus says the Lord \nd God\nd*.’ \x + \xo 3:27 \xt [Rev. 22:11]\x*He who will hear, let him hear; and he who will refuse to hear, let him refuse, for they are a rebellious house.

\s1 The Siege of Jerusalem Symbolized
\p \v 1 “And you, \x + \xo 4:1 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*son of man, \x + \xo 4:1 \xt [ver. 3; Jer. 13:1, 2]\x*take a brick and lay it before you, and engrave on it a city, even Jerusalem.

This is \x + \xo 4:3 \xt ch. 12:6, 11; 24:24, 27; [Isa. 8:18; 20:3]\x*a sign for the house of Israel.
\p

\s1 Abominations in the Temple
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 8:1 \xt [ch. 1:2]; See ch. 20:1 \x*In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, \x + \xo 8:1 \xt [2 Kgs. 6:32] \x*as I sat in my house, with \x + \xo 8:1 \xt ver. 11, 12; ch. 14:1; 20:1, 3 \x*the elders of Judah sitting before me, \x + \xo 8:1 \xt See ch. 1:3\x*the hand of the Lord \nd God\nd* fell upon me there.
\v 2 Then I looked, and behold, \x + \xo 8:2 \xt ch. 1:27 \x*a form that had the appearance of a man.\f + \fr 8:2 \ft By revocalization (compare Septuagint); Hebrew \fq of fire\f* \x + \xo 8:2 \xt ch. 1:27 \x*Below what appeared to be his waist was fire, and above his waist was something like the appearance of brightness, like \x + \xo 8:2 \xt ch. 1:4, 27\x*gleaming metal.\f + \fr 8:2 \ft Or \fq amber\f*
\v 3 He \x + \xo 8:3 \xt [Dan. 5:5]; See ch. 2:9 \x*put out the form of a hand and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up \x + \xo 8:3 \xt [2 Cor. 12:2, 4] \x*between earth and heaven and \x + \xo 8:3 \xt ch. 11:1, 24; 40:2 \x*brought me in \x + \xo 8:3 \xt See ch. 1:1 \x*visions of God to Jerusalem, \x + \xo 8:3 \xt ver. 14 \x*to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, \x + \xo 8:3 \xt [ch. 5:11] \x*where was the seat of the \x + \xo 8:3 \xt [Deut. 4:16] \x*image of jealousy, \x + \xo 8:3 \xt Deut. 32:16, 21\x*which provokes to jealousy.
\v 4 And behold, \x + \xo 8:4 \xt See ch. 1:28 \x*the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw \x + \xo 8:4 \xt See ch. 3:22\x*in the valley.
\p
\v 5 Then he said to me, \x + \xo 8:5 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*“Son of man, lift up your eyes now toward the north.” So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of \x + \xo 8:5 \xt See ver. 16 \x*the altar gate, in the entrance, was this \x + \xo 8:5 \xt [See ver. 3 above]\x*image of jealousy.
\v 6 And he said to me, “Son of man, \x + \xo 8:6 \xt [ch. 47:6] \x*do you see what they are doing, \x + \xo 8:6 \xt See ch. 5:11 \x*the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, \x + \xo 8:6 \xt [ch. 10:18, 19]\x*to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations.”
\p
\v 7 And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.
\v 8 Then he said to me, “Son of man, \x + \xo 8:8 \xt [ch. 12:5]\x*dig in the wall.” So I dug in the wall, and behold, there was an entrance.
\v 9 And he said to me, “Go in, and see \x + \xo 8:9 \xt See ch. 5:11\x*the vile abominations that they are committing here.”
\v 10 So I went in and saw. And there, \x + \xo 8:10 \xt ch. 23:14 \x*engraved on the wall all around, was \x + \xo 8:10 \xt See Ex. 20:4 \x*every form of \x + \xo 8:10 \xt Lev. 11:20; Rom. 1:23\x*creeping things and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.

\v 12 Then he said to me, “Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [ver. 7] \x*in the dark, each \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [ver. 10] \x*in his room of pictures?

\v 13 He said also to me, \x + \xo 8:13 \xt ver. 6\x*“You will see still greater abominations that they commit.”
\p
\v 14 Then he brought me to \x + \xo 8:14 \xt ver. 3\x*the entrance of the north gate of the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.
\v 15 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O \x + \xo 8:15 \xt [See ver. 5 above] \x*son of man? \x + \xo 8:15 \xt [See ver. 13 above]\x*You will see still greater abominations than these.”
\p
\v 16 And he brought me into \x + \xo 8:16 \xt ch. 10:3; 40:28; 43:5; 45:19; 46:1; 1 Kgs. 6:36 \x*the inner court of the house of the \nd Lord\nd*.

\v 17 Then he said to me, “Have you seen this, O \x + \xo 8:17 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*son of man? Is it too light a thing for the house of Judah to commit \x + \xo 8:17 \xt See ch. 5:11 \x*the abominations that they commit here, that \x + \xo 8:17 \xt [ch. 7:11, 23] \x*they should fill the land with violence and \x + \xo 8:17 \xt Jer. 7:18, 19; [ch. 20:28]\x*provoke me still further to anger?

\s1 Idolaters Killed
\p \v 1 Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, “Bring near the executioners of the city, \x + \xo 9:1 \xt [ch. 43:3]\x*each with his destroying weapon in his hand.”
\v 2 And behold, six men came from the direction of \x + \xo 9:2 \xt 2 Kgs. 15:35; Jer. 20:2 \x*the upper gate, which faces north, each with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was \x + \xo 9:2 \xt ch. 10:2, 6, 7; Dan. 10:5; 12:6, 7 \x*a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his waist. And they went in and stood beside \x + \xo 9:2 \xt [ch. 8:16]\x*the bronze altar.
\p
\v 3 Now \x + \xo 9:3 \xt See ch. 1:28 \x*the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherub on which it rested to \x + \xo 9:3 \xt ch. 10:4, 18; 46:2; 47:1 \x*the threshold of the house. And he called to \x + \xo 9:3 \xt [See ver. 2 above]\x*the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his waist.
\v 4 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to him, “Pass through the city, through Jerusalem, and \x + \xo 9:4 \xt Rev. 3:12; 7:3; 9:4; 14:1; 22:4; [Ex. 12:7; Rev. 13:16, 17; 14:9; 20:4] \x*put a mark on the foreheads of the men who \x + \xo 9:4 \xt [Ps. 119:53, 136, 158]\x*sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it.”
\v 5 And to \x + \xo 9:5 \xt [ver. 2] \x*the others he said in my hearing, “Pass through the city after him, and strike. \x + \xo 9:5 \xt See ch. 5:11\x*Your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity.
\v 6 \x + \xo 9:6 \xt [2 Chr. 36:17] \x*Kill old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but \x + \xo 9:6 \xt [Rev. 9:4] \x*touch no one on whom is the mark. And \x + \xo 9:6 \xt See Jer. 25:29\x*begin at my sanctuary.” So they began with the elders who were before the house.
\v 7 Then he said to them, \x + \xo 9:7 \xt ch. 7:21, 22\x*“Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go out.” So they went out and struck in the city.
\v 8 And while they were striking, and I was left alone, \x + \xo 9:8 \xt ch. 11:13; [Num. 14:5] \x*I fell upon my face, and cried, \x + \xo 9:8 \xt See ch. 4:14 \x*“Ah, Lord \nd God\nd*! \x + \xo 9:8 \xt ch. 11:13 \x*Will you destroy all the remnant of Israel \x + \xo 9:8 \xt See ch. 7:8\x*in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?”
\p
\v 9 Then he said to me, \x + \xo 9:9 \xt See 2 Chr. 36:14-16 \x*“The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great. \x + \xo 9:9 \xt See ch. 7:23 \x*The land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice. For \x + \xo 9:9 \xt See ch. 8:12\x*they say, ‘The \nd Lord\nd* has forsaken the land, and the \nd Lord\nd* does not see.’
\v 10 As for me, \x + \xo 9:10 \xt See ch. 5:11 \x*my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; \x + \xo 9:10 \xt See ch. 7:4\x*I will bring their deeds upon their heads.”
\p
\v 11 And behold, \x + \xo 9:11 \xt ch. 10:2, 6, 7; Dan. 10:5; 12:6, 7\x*the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his waist, brought back word, saying, “I have done as you commanded me.”

\s1 The Glory of the \nd Lord\nd* Leaves the Temple
\p \v 1 Then I looked, and behold, \x + \xo 10:1 \xt [ch. 1:22] \x*on the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something \x + \xo 10:1 \xt See ch. 1:26\x*like a sapphire,\f + \fr 10:1 \ft Or \fq lapis lazuli\f* in appearance like a throne.
\v 2 And he said to \x + \xo 10:2 \xt See ch. 9:2 \x*the man clothed in linen, “Go in among \x + \xo 10:2 \xt ver. 6, 13 \x*the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim.

\p And he went in \x + \xo 10:2 \xt ver. 19\x*before my eyes.
\v 3 Now the cherubim were standing \x + \xo 10:3 \xt [Luke 1:11] \x*on the south side of the house, when the man went in, and \x + \xo 10:3 \xt See 1 Kgs. 8:10 \x*a cloud filled \x + \xo 10:3 \xt See ch. 8:16\x*the inner court.
\v 4 And \x + \xo 10:4 \xt See ch. 1:28 \x*the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 10:4 \xt ver. 18, 19 \x*went up from the cherub to the threshold of the house, and the house \x + \xo 10:4 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with \x + \xo 10:4 \xt [ch. 43:2]\x*the brightness of the glory of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 5 And \x + \xo 10:5 \xt ch. 1:24\x*the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, \x + \xo 10:5 \xt ch. 1:24\x*like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
\p
\v 6 And when he commanded \x + \xo 10:6 \xt See ch. 9:2 \x*the man clothed in linen, \x + \xo 10:6 \xt [ver. 2] \x*“Take fire from between \x + \xo 10:6 \xt ver. 2\x*the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim,” he went in and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 And a cherub stretched out his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.
\v 8 The cherubim appeared to have \x + \xo 10:8 \xt [ver. 21; ch. 1:8; 8:3]\x*the form of a human hand under their wings.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 10:9 \xt [ch. 1:15] \x*And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub, and \x + \xo 10:9 \xt ch. 1:16 \x*the appearance of the wheels was \x + \xo 10:9 \xt [ch. 1:4] \x*like sparkling \x + \xo 10:9 \xt [ch. 1:16; Dan. 10:6]\x*beryl.
\v 10 And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.

\v 14 \x + \xo 10:14 \xt [ch. 1:6] \x*And every one had four faces: \x + \xo 10:14 \xt [ch. 1:10] \x*the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was \x + \xo 10:14 \xt [ch. 1:5, 10; 41:19]\x*a human face, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15 \xt ver. 17, 19 \x*And the cherubim mounted up. These were \x + \xo 10:15 \xt ch. 1:5 \x*the living creatures that I saw by \x + \xo 10:15 \xt See ch. 1:1\x*the Chebar canal.

\s1 Jerusalem, a Useless Vine
\p \v 1 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me:

\v 23 “And after all your wickedness (woe, woe to you! declares the Lord \nd God\nd*),

\s1 Israel’s Shedding of Blood
\p \v 1 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me, saying,

\s1 Oholah and Oholibah
\p \v 1 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me:
\v 2 \x + \xo 23:2 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*“Son of man, there were \x + \xo 23:2 \xt [ch. 16:45, 46]\x*two women, the daughters of one mother.
\v 3 \x + \xo 23:3 \xt See ch. 16:15 \x*They played the whore in Egypt; \x + \xo 23:3 \xt See ch. 16:15 \x*they played the whore \x + \xo 23:3 \xt [ch. 16:22]\x*in their youth; there their breasts were pressed and their virgin bosoms\f + \fr 23:3 \ft Hebrew \fq nipples\ft ; also verses 8, 21\f* handled.
\v 4 Oholah was the name of the elder and Oholibah the name of her sister. \x + \xo 23:4 \xt ch. 16:8 \x*They became mine, and they \x + \xo 23:4 \xt [ver. 37] \x*bore sons and daughters. As for their names, Oholah is \x + \xo 23:4 \xt [ch. 16:46]\x*Samaria, and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 “Oholah played the whore \x + \xo 23:5 \xt Num. 5:19, 20 \x*while she was mine, and \x + \xo 23:5 \xt [Hos. 2:5] \x*she lusted after her lovers \x + \xo 23:5 \xt 2 Kgs. 15:19; 17:3; Hos. 8:9\x*the Assyrians, warriors

\v 7 She bestowed her whoring upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them, and she defiled herself with all the idols of everyone after whom she lusted.
\v 8 She did not give up her whoring \x + \xo 23:8 \xt [ver. 3, 19]\x*that she had begun in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their whoring lust upon her.
\v 9 Therefore \x + \xo 23:9 \xt [2 Kgs. 15:29]; See 2 Kgs. 17:4-6, 23; 18:9-11\x*I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, after whom she lusted.
\v 10 \x + \xo 23:10 \xt ver. 29; See ch. 16:37 \x*These uncovered her nakedness; \x + \xo 23:10 \xt ver. 25 \x*they seized her sons and her daughters; and as for her, they killed her with the sword; and she became \x + \xo 23:10 \xt [ch. 16:14] \x*a byword among women, \x + \xo 23:10 \xt See ch. 5:8\x*when judgment had been executed on her.
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 23:11 \xt Jer. 3:8, 9 \x*“Her sister Oholibah saw this, and she became \x + \xo 23:11 \xt Jer. 3:11; See ch. 16:47\x*more corrupt than her sister\f + \fr 23:11 \ft Hebrew \fq than she\f* in her lust and in her whoring, which was worse than that of her sister.

\v 13 And I saw that she was defiled; they both took the same way.
\v 14 But she carried her whoring further. She saw men \x + \xo 23:14 \xt ch. 8:10 \x*portrayed on the wall, the \x + \xo 23:14 \xt [ch. 16:17] \x*images of \x + \xo 23:14 \xt ch. 16:29; [2 Kgs. 20:12, 13; 24:1]\x*the Chaldeans portrayed in vermilion,
\v 15 wearing belts on their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them having the appearance of officers, a likeness of Babylonians whose native land was Chaldea.
\v 16 When she saw them, she lusted after them and \x + \xo 23:16 \xt [ver. 40; Isa. 57:9] \x*sent messengers to them \x + \xo 23:16 \xt [See ver. 14 above]\x*in Chaldea.
\v 17 And the Babylonians came to her \x + \xo 23:17 \xt [ver. 41; Isa. 57:7, 8] \x*into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoring lust. And after she was defiled by them, \x + \xo 23:17 \xt ver. 22, 28; [ch. 17:15]\x*she turned from them in disgust.
\v 18 When she carried on her whoring so openly and flaunted her nakedness, I turned in disgust from her, as I had turned in disgust from her sister.
\v 19 Yet she increased her whoring, \x + \xo 23:19 \xt [ver. 3]; See ch. 16:15\x*remembering the days of her youth, when she played the whore in the land of Egypt
\v 20 and lusted after her lovers there, whose members were like those of donkeys, and whose issue was like that of horses.
\v 21 Thus you longed for the lewdness of your youth, when the Egyptians handled your bosom and pressed\f + \fr 23:21 \ft Vulgate, Syriac; Hebrew \fq bosom for the sake of\f* your young breasts.”
\p
\v 22 Therefore, O Oholibah, thus says the Lord \nd God\nd*: “Behold, I will stir up against you your lovers \x + \xo 23:22 \xt [See ver. 17 above] \x*from whom you turned in disgust, \x + \xo 23:22 \xt ch. 16:37\x*and I will bring them against you from every side:

\p
\v 28 “For thus says the Lord \nd God\nd*: \x + \xo 23:28 \xt ch. 16:37 \x*Behold, I will deliver you into the hands of those whom you hate, \x + \xo 23:28 \xt ver. 17, 22\x*into the hands of those from whom you turned in disgust,

\v 6 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to \x + \xo 36:6 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*the mountains and hills, to the ravines and valleys, Thus says the Lord \nd God\nd*: \x + \xo 36:6 \xt [ver. 5] \x*Behold, I have spoken in my jealous wrath, because you have suffered \x + \xo 36:6 \xt See ch. 32:24\x*the reproach of the nations.

\s1 The \nd Lord\nd*’s Concern for His Holy Name
\p
\v 16 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me:
\v 17 \x + \xo 36:17 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*“Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, \x + \xo 36:17 \xt See Lev. 18:25 \x*they defiled it by their ways and their deeds. Their ways before me were \x + \xo 36:17 \xt See Lev. 18:19\x*like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.
\v 18 So \x + \xo 36:18 \xt See ch. 7:8 \x*I poured out my wrath upon them \x + \xo 36:18 \xt ch. 16:36; 22:3 \x*for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols \x + \xo 36:18 \xt See ch. 5:11\x*with which they had defiled it.

\v 20 But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, \x + \xo 36:20 \xt Isa. 52:5; [ch. 22:26; Rom. 2:24]\x*they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, ‘These are the people of the \nd Lord\nd*, and yet they had to go out of his land.’
\v 21 But I had concern \x + \xo 36:21 \xt [ch. 20:9; Isa. 43:25; 48:11]\x*for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.

\s1 The Valley of Dry Bones
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 37:1 \xt See ch. 1:3 \x*The hand of the \nd Lord\nd* was upon me, and \x + \xo 37:1 \xt See ch. 3:12\x*he brought me out in the Spirit of the \nd Lord\nd* and set me down in the middle of the valley;\f + \fr 37:1 \ft Or \fq plain\ft ; also verse 2\f* it was full of bones.
\v 2 And he led me around among them, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley, and behold, they were very dry.
\v 3 And he said to me, \x + \xo 37:3 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*“Son of man, \x + \xo 37:3 \xt [1 Cor. 15:35] \x*can these bones live?” And \x + \xo 37:3 \xt [Deut. 32:39; John 5:21]\x*I answered, “O Lord \nd God\nd*, you know.”
\v 4 Then he said to me, \x + \xo 37:4 \xt [ch. 6:2] \x*“Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, \x + \xo 37:4 \xt [John 5:28]\x*O dry bones, hear the word of the \nd Lord\nd*.

\v 3 Facing \x + \xo 42:3 \xt ch. 41:10 \x*the twenty cubits that belonged to the inner court, and facing \x + \xo 42:3 \xt ch. 40:17 \x*the pavement that belonged to the outer court, was \x + \xo 42:3 \xt [ver. 5; ch. 41:15, 16]\x*gallery\f + \fr 42:3 \ft The meaning of the Hebrew word is unknown; also verse 5\f* against gallery in three stories.
\v 4 And \x + \xo 42:4 \xt [ch. 46:19] \x*before the chambers was a passage inward, ten cubits wide and \x + \xo 42:4 \xt [ver. 11]\x*a hundred cubits long,\f + \fr 42:4 \ft Septuagint, Syriac; Hebrew \fq and a way of one cubit\f* and \x + \xo 42:4 \xt [ch. 46:19] \x*their doors were on the north.
\v 5 Now the upper chambers were narrower, for the galleries took more away from them than from the lower and middle chambers of the building.
\v 6 For they were in three stories, and they had no pillars like the pillars of the courts. Thus the upper chambers were set back from the ground more than the lower and the middle ones.
\v 7 And \x + \xo 42:7 \xt [ver. 10, 12] \x*there was a wall outside parallel to the chambers, toward the outer court, opposite the chambers, \x + \xo 42:7 \xt [ver. 2]\x*fifty cubits long.
\v 8 For the chambers on the outer court were fifty cubits long, while those opposite \x + \xo 42:8 \xt ch. 41:1, 21, 23 \x*the nave\f + \fr 42:8 \ft Or \fq temple\f* were \x + \xo 42:8 \xt [ch. 41:13, 14]\x*a hundred cubits long.
\v 9 Below these chambers was \x + \xo 42:9 \xt ch. 44:5; 46:19\x*an entrance on the east side, as one enters them from the outer court.

\v 10 In the thickness of \x + \xo 42:10 \xt [ver. 7] \x*the wall of the court, on the south\f + \fr 42:10 \ft Septuagint; Hebrew \fq east\f* also, opposite \x + \xo 42:10 \xt [ver. 1] \x*the yard and opposite \x + \xo 42:10 \xt [ver. 1] \x*the building, there were \x + \xo 42:10 \xt See ch. 40:17\x*chambers
\v 11 with \x + \xo 42:11 \xt [ver. 4]\x*a passage in front of them. They were similar to the chambers on the north, of the same length and breadth, with the same exits\f + \fr 42:11 \ft Hebrew \fq and all their exits\f* and arrangements and \x + \xo 42:11 \xt [ver. 4]\x*doors,
\v 12 as were the entrances of the chambers on the south. There was an entrance at the beginning of the passage, the passage before \x + \xo 42:12 \xt [See ver. 10 above]\x*the corresponding wall on the east as one enters them.\f + \fr 42:12 \ft The meaning of the Hebrew verse is uncertain\f*
\p
\v 13 Then he said to me, “The north chambers and the south chambers opposite \x + \xo 42:13 \xt [See ver. 10 above] \x*the yard are the holy chambers, \x + \xo 42:13 \xt ch. 40:46 \x*where the priests who approach the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 42:13 \xt Lev. 6:16, 26; 10:13; 24:9 \x*shall eat the \x + \xo 42:13 \xt Num. 18:9 \x*most holy offerings.

\v 14 When the priests enter the Holy Place, they shall not go out of it into the outer court \x + \xo 42:14 \xt ch. 44:19; Lev. 6:11\x*without laying there the garments in which they minister, for these are holy. \x + \xo 42:14 \xt ch. 44:19; Lev. 6:11\x*They shall put on other garments before they go near to that which is for the people.”
\p
\v 15 Now when he had finished measuring the interior of the temple area, he led me out by \x + \xo 42:15 \xt See ch. 43:1\x*the gate that faced east, and measured the temple area all around.
\v 16 He measured the east side with \x + \xo 42:16 \xt [ch. 40:3]\x*the measuring reed, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
\v 17 He measured the north side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed all around.
\v 18 He measured the south side, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
\v 19 Then he turned to the west side and measured, 500 cubits by the measuring reed.
\v 20 He measured it on the four sides. It had \x + \xo 42:20 \xt ch. 40:5 \x*a wall around it, \x + \xo 42:20 \xt [ch. 45:2; Rev. 21:16] \x*500 cubits long and \x + \xo 42:20 \xt [ch. 45:2; Rev. 21:16] \x*500 cubits broad, \x + \xo 42:20 \xt [ch. 22:26; 43:12; 44:23; 48:15]\x*to make a separation between the holy and the common.

\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 43:6 \xt See ch. 40:3 \x*While the man was standing beside me, \x + \xo 43:6 \xt [Ex. 25:22]\x*I heard one speaking to me out of the temple,

\v 10 “As for you, \x + \xo 43:10 \xt [See ver. 7 above] \x*son of man, \x + \xo 43:10 \xt ch. 40:4\x*describe to the house of Israel the temple, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and they shall measure the plan.

\p
\v 18 And he said to me, \x + \xo 43:18 \xt See ch. 2:1 \x*“Son of man, thus says the Lord \nd God\nd*: These are the ordinances for the altar: On the day when it is erected for offering burnt offerings upon it and \x + \xo 43:18 \xt See Lev. 1:5\x*for throwing blood against it,

\v 5 Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen. It was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
