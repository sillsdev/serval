\v 1 An \x + \xo 19:1 \xt See ch. 13:1 \x*oracle concerning \x + \xo 19:1 \xt [Joel 3:19]; See Jer. 46:13-26; Ezek. 29:1–31:2; 31:18–32:32 \x*Egypt.
\b
\q1 Behold, the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 19:1 \xt Ps. 18:10, 11; 104:3; [Matt. 26:64; Rev. 1:7] \x*is riding on a swift cloud
\q2 and comes to Egypt;
\q1 and \x + \xo 19:1 \xt Ex. 12:12; [1 Sam. 5:3; Jer. 43:12; 50:2] \x*the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence,
\q2 and the heart of the Egyptians will \x + \xo 19:1 \xt ch. 13:7; See Josh. 2:11\x*melt within them.
\q1
\v 2 And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians,
\q2 \x + \xo 19:2 \xt [Judg. 7:22]\x*and they will fight, each against another
\q2 and each against his neighbor,
\q2 city against city, kingdom against kingdom;
\q1
\v 3 and the spirit of the Egyptians within them will be emptied out,
\q2 and I will confound\f + \fr 19:3 \ft Or \fq I will swallow up\f* their \x + \xo 19:3 \xt ver. 11 \x*counsel;
\q1 and they will inquire of the idols and the sorcerers,
\q2 and \x + \xo 19:3 \xt ch. 8:19\x*the mediums and the necromancers;
\q1
\v 4 and I will give over the Egyptians
\q2 into the hand of \x + \xo 19:4 \xt ch. 20:4; Jer. 46:26; Ezek. 29:19\x*a hard master,
\q1 and a fierce king will rule over them,
\q2 declares the Lord \nd God\nd* of hosts.
\b
\q1
\v 5 And the waters of the sea will be dried up,
\q2 and the river will be dry and parched,
\q1
\v 6 and its canals will become foul,
\q2 and the branches of Egypt’s Nile will diminish and dry up,
\q2 reeds and rushes will rot away.
\q1
\v 7 There will be bare places by the Nile,
\q2 on the brink of the Nile,
\q1 and all that is sown by the Nile will be parched,
\q2 will be driven away, and will be no more.
\q1
\v 8 The \x + \xo 19:8 \xt [Num. 11:5]\x*fishermen will mourn and lament,
\q2 all who cast a hook in the Nile;
\q1 and they will languish
\q2 who spread nets on the water.
\q1
\v 9 The workers in \x + \xo 19:9 \xt [Ezek. 27:7]\x*combed flax will be in despair,
\q2 and the weavers of white cotton.
\q1
\v 10 Those who are the \x + \xo 19:10 \xt [Gal. 2:9] \x*pillars of the land will be crushed,
\q2 and all who \x + \xo 19:10 \xt Jer. 46:21\x*work for pay will be grieved.
\b
\q1
\v 11 The princes of \x + \xo 19:11 \xt ch. 30:4; Num. 13:22; Ps. 78:43\x*Zoan are utterly foolish;
\q2 the wisest counselors of Pharaoh give stupid counsel.
\q1 How can you say to Pharaoh,
\q2 “I am a son of the wise,
\q2 a son of ancient kings”?
\q1
\v 12 Where then are your \x + \xo 19:12 \xt 1 Kgs. 4:30; Acts 7:22\x*wise men?
\q2 Let them tell you
\q2 that they might know what the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has purposed against Egypt.
\q1
\v 13 The princes of \x + \xo 19:13 \xt [See ver. 11 above] \x*Zoan have become fools,
\q2 and the princes of \x + \xo 19:13 \xt Jer. 2:16; 44:1; 46:14, 19; Ezek. 30:13, 16 \x*Memphis are deluded;
\q1 those who are the \x + \xo 19:13 \xt [Zech. 10:4]\x*cornerstones of her tribes
\q2 have made Egypt stagger.
\q1
\v 14 The \nd Lord\nd* has mingled within her \x + \xo 19:14 \xt [1 Kgs. 22:22] \x*a spirit of confusion,
\q1 and they will make Egypt stagger in all its deeds,
\q2 \x + \xo 19:14 \xt [ch. 24:20; 29:9]\x*as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.
\q1
\v 15 And there will be nothing for Egypt
\q2 that \x + \xo 19:15 \xt ch. 9:14\x*head or tail, palm branch or reed, may do.
\s1 Egypt, Assyria, Israel Blessed
\p
\v 16 In that day the Egyptians will be \x + \xo 19:16 \xt Jer. 50:37; 51:30; Nah. 3:13 \x*like women, and \x + \xo 19:16 \xt ch. 10:32\x*tremble with fear before the hand that the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts shakes over them.
\v 17 And the land of Judah will become a terror to the Egyptians. Everyone to whom it is mentioned will fear because of the purpose that the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has purposed against them.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 19:18 \xt ver. 21 \x*In that day there will be \x + \xo 19:18 \xt [ch. 30:17; 2 Kgs. 7:13] \x*five cities in the land of Egypt that \x + \xo 19:18 \xt [Zeph. 3:9]\x*speak the language of Canaan and swear allegiance to the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts. One of these will be called the City of Destruction.\f + \fr 19:18 \ft Dead Sea Scroll and some other manuscripts \fq City of the Sun\f*
\p
\v 19 In that day there will be an \x + \xo 19:19 \xt [2 Kgs. 5:17] \x*altar to the \nd Lord\nd* in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a \x + \xo 19:19 \xt [Gen. 28:18]\x*pillar to the \nd Lord\nd* at its border.
\v 20 \x + \xo 19:20 \xt [See ver. 19 above] \x*It will be a sign and a witness to the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts in the land of Egypt. When they cry to the \nd Lord\nd* because of oppressors, \x + \xo 19:20 \xt [Obad. 21]\x*he will send them a savior and defender, and deliver them.
\v 21 \x + \xo 19:21 \xt [ver. 25] \x*And the \nd Lord\nd* will make himself known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians will know the \nd Lord\nd* in that day \x + \xo 19:21 \xt Zech. 14:16-18; [ch. 2:2]\x*and worship with sacrifice and offering, and they will make vows to the \nd Lord\nd* and perform them.
\v 22 \x + \xo 19:22 \xt Jer. 46:25, 26\x*And the \nd Lord\nd* will strike Egypt, striking and healing, and they will return to the \nd Lord\nd*, and he will listen to their pleas for mercy and heal them.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 19:23 \xt ch. 11:16 \x*In that day there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and Assyria will come into Egypt, and Egypt into Assyria, \x + \xo 19:23 \xt [ver. 18, 21; Zeph. 3:9]\x*and the Egyptians will worship with the Assyrians.
\p
\v 24 In that day Israel will be the third with Egypt and Assyria, \x + \xo 19:24 \xt [Gen. 12:2, 3]\x*a blessing in the midst of the earth,
\v 25 whom the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has blessed, saying, “Blessed be Egypt \x + \xo 19:25 \xt [Hos. 2:23] \x*my people, and Assyria \x + \xo 19:25 \xt ch. 29:23 \x*the work of my hands, and \x + \xo 19:25 \xt Deut. 32:9\x*Israel my inheritance.”

\s1 A Sign Against Egypt and Cush
\p
\v 1 In the year that \x + \xo 20:1 \xt 2 Kgs. 18:17 \x*the commander in chief, who was sent by Sargon the king of Assyria, came to \x + \xo 20:1 \xt 1 Sam. 5:1\x*Ashdod and fought against it and captured it—
\v 2 at that time the \nd Lord\nd* spoke by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, “Go, and loose the sackcloth from your waist and take off your sandals from your feet,” and he did so, walking \x + \xo 20:2 \xt Mic. 1:8, 11; [1 Sam. 19:24]\x*naked and barefoot.
\p
\v 3 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said, “As my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot for three years \x + \xo 20:3 \xt [ch. 8:18]\x*as a sign and a portent against Egypt and Cush,\f + \fr 20:3 \ft Probably \fq Nubia\f*
\v 4 so shall the \x + \xo 20:4 \xt ch. 19:4\x*king of Assyria lead away the Egyptian captives and the Cushite exiles, both the young and the old, naked and barefoot, with buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt.
\v 5 \x + \xo 20:5 \xt ch. 30:3, 5; [ch. 37:9]\x*Then they shall be dismayed and ashamed because of Cush their hope and of Egypt their boast.
\v 6 And the inhabitants of \x + \xo 20:6 \xt Jer. 47:7; [ch. 14:29, 31] \x*this coastland will say in that day, ‘Behold, this is what has happened to those in whom we hoped and \x + \xo 20:6 \xt [ch. 37:6]\x*to whom we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria! And we, how shall we escape?’”

\s1 Fallen, Fallen Is Babylon
\p
\v 1 The \x + \xo 21:1 \xt See ch. 13:1 \x*oracle concerning the wilderness of \x + \xo 21:1 \xt Jer. 51:36, 42 \x*the sea.
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 21:1 \xt Jer. 51:1\x*As whirlwinds in the Negeb sweep on,
\q2 it comes from the wilderness,
\q2 from a terrible land.
\q1
\v 2 A stern vision is told to me;
\q2 \x + \xo 21:2 \xt ch. 24:16; 33:1 \x*the traitor betrays,
\q2 and the destroyer destroys.
\q1 Go up, O \x + \xo 21:2 \xt See ch. 11:11 \x*Elam;
\q2 lay siege, O \x + \xo 21:2 \xt See ch. 13:17 \x*Media;
\q1 all the \x + \xo 21:2 \xt Ezek. 9:4\x*sighing she has caused
\q2 I bring to an end.
\q1
\v 3 Therefore my loins are filled with anguish;
\q2 \x + \xo 21:3 \xt See ch. 13:8\x*pangs have seized me,
\q2 like the pangs of a woman in labor;
\q1 I am bowed down so that I cannot hear;
\q2 I am dismayed so that I cannot see.
\q1
\v 4 My heart staggers; horror has appalled me;
\q2 \x + \xo 21:4 \xt [Deut. 28:67]\x*the twilight I longed for
\q2 has been turned for me into trembling.
\q1
\v 5 \x + \xo 21:5 \xt Jer. 51:39, 57 \x*They prepare the table,
\q2 they spread the rugs,\f + \fr 21:5 \ft Or \fq they set the watchman\f*
\q2 they eat, they drink.
\q1 Arise, O princes;
\q2 \x + \xo 21:5 \xt 2 Sam. 1:21\x*oil the shield!
\q1
\v 6 For thus the Lord said to me:
\q1 “Go, set a watchman;
\q2 let him announce what he sees.
\q1
\v 7 When he sees riders, horsemen in pairs,
\q2 riders on donkeys, riders on camels,
\q1 let him listen diligently,
\q2 very diligently.”
\q1
\v 8 Then he who saw cried out:\f + \fr 21:8 \ft Dead Sea Scroll, Syriac; Masoretic Text \fq Then a lion cried out\ft , or \fq Then he cried out like a lion\f*
\q1 \x + \xo 21:8 \xt Hab. 2:1\x*“Upon a watchtower I stand, O Lord,
\q2 continually by day,
\q1 and at my post I am stationed
\q2 whole nights.
\q1
\v 9 And behold, here come riders,
\q2 horsemen in pairs!”
\q1 \x + \xo 21:9 \xt [Hab. 2:2] \x*And he answered,
\q2 \x + \xo 21:9 \xt Jer. 51:8; Cited Rev. 14:8; 18:2 \x*“Fallen, fallen is Babylon;
\q1 \x + \xo 21:9 \xt ch. 46:1\x*and all the carved images of her gods
\q2 he has shattered to the ground.”
\q1
\v 10 O \x + \xo 21:10 \xt Jer. 51:33; Amos 1:3; [Mic. 4:13]\x*my threshed and winnowed one,
\q2 what I have heard from the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\q2 the God of Israel, I announce to you.
\b
\p
\v 11 The \x + \xo 21:11 \xt See ch. 13:1 \x*oracle concerning \x + \xo 21:11 \xt Gen. 25:14; 1 Chr. 1:30 \x*Dumah.
\b
\q1 One is calling to me from \x + \xo 21:11 \xt Deut. 2:8; Ezek. 35:2\x*Seir,
\q2 “Watchman, what time of the night?
\q2 Watchman, what time of the night?”
\q1
\v 12 The watchman says:
\q1 “Morning comes, and also \x + \xo 21:12 \xt [Job 36:20; Amos 5:8] \x*the night.
\q2 If you will inquire, \x + \xo 21:12 \xt [Ps. 37:36]\x*inquire;
\q2 come back again.”
\b
\p
\v 13 The \x + \xo 21:13 \xt See ch. 13:1 \x*oracle concerning \x + \xo 21:13 \xt Gen. 25:3; Jer. 25:23, 24 \x*Arabia.
\b
\q1 In the thickets in \x + \xo 21:13 \xt Gen. 25:3; Jer. 25:23, 24 \x*Arabia you will lodge,
\q2 O \x + \xo 21:13 \xt [Gen. 37:25]\x*caravans of \x + \xo 21:13 \xt Gen. 25:3; Jer. 25:23, 24 \x*Dedanites.
\q1
\v 14 To the thirsty bring water;
\q2 meet the fugitive with bread,
\q2 O inhabitants of the land of \x + \xo 21:14 \xt Job 6:19\x*Tema.
\q1
\v 15 For they have fled from the swords,
\q2 from the drawn sword,
\q1 from the bent bow,
\q2 and from the press of battle.
\b
\p
\v 16 For thus the Lord said to me, “Within a year, \x + \xo 21:16 \xt See ch. 16:14 \x*according to the years of a hired worker, all the glory of \x + \xo 21:16 \xt ch. 60:7; Gen. 25:13; Ps. 120:5, 6; Song 1:5; Jer. 2:10; 49:28; Ezek. 27:21\x*Kedar will come to an end.
\v 17 And the remainder of the archers of the mighty men of the sons of \x + \xo 21:17 \xt [See ver. 16 above] \x*Kedar will be few, \x + \xo 21:17 \xt ch. 1:20\x*for the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, has spoken.”

\s1 An Oracle Concerning Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 The \x + \xo 22:1 \xt See ch. 13:1 \x*oracle concerning \x + \xo 22:1 \xt ver. 5; Jer. 21:13; [Joel 3:12, 14]\x*the valley of vision.
\b
\q1 What do you mean that you have gone up,
\q2 all of you, to the housetops,
\q1
\v 2 you who are full of shoutings,
\q2 tumultuous city, \x + \xo 22:2 \xt ch. 32:13 \x*exultant town?
\q1 Your slain are \x + \xo 22:2 \xt Lam. 4:9\x*not slain with the sword
\q2 or dead in battle.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 22:3 \xt [ch. 1:10]\x*All your leaders have fled together;
\q2 without the bow they were captured.
\q1 All of you who were found were captured,
\q2 though they had fled far away.
\q1
\v 4 Therefore I said:
\q1 “Look away from me;
\q2 \x + \xo 22:4 \xt Jer. 9:1; Mic. 1:8\x*let me weep bitter tears;
\q1 do not labor to comfort me
\q2 concerning the destruction of the daughter of my people.”
\b
\q1
\v 5 \x + \xo 22:5 \xt ch. 2:12-17 \x*For the Lord \nd God\nd* of hosts has \x + \xo 22:5 \xt [ch. 37:3] \x*a day
\q2 of tumult and \x + \xo 22:5 \xt ch. 10:6; 18:2 \x*trampling and \x + \xo 22:5 \xt Mic. 7:4 \x*confusion
\q2 in \x + \xo 22:5 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*the valley of vision,
\q1 a battering down of walls
\q2 and a shouting to the mountains.
\q1
\v 6 And \x + \xo 22:6 \xt See ch. 11:11 \x*Elam bore the quiver
\q2 with chariots and horsemen,
\q2 and \x + \xo 22:6 \xt 2 Kgs. 16:9\x*Kir uncovered the shield.
\q1
\v 7 Your choicest valleys were full of chariots,
\q2 and the horsemen took their stand at the gates.
\q1
\v 8 He has taken away \x + \xo 22:8 \xt ch. 30:1 \x*the covering of Judah.
\b
\p In that day you looked to \x + \xo 22:8 \xt 1 Kgs. 10:17\x*the weapons of the House of the Forest,
\v 9 and you saw that \x + \xo 22:9 \xt ver. 5, 10; [2 Chr. 32:5] \x*the breaches of the city of David were many. \x + \xo 22:9 \xt [Neh. 3:16]\x*You collected the waters of the lower pool,
\v 10 and you counted the houses of Jerusalem, and you broke down the houses to fortify the wall.
\v 11 \x + \xo 22:11 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*You made a reservoir between \x + \xo 22:11 \xt [2 Kgs. 25:4] \x*the two walls for the water of \x + \xo 22:11 \xt [ch. 7:3; 2 Kgs. 20:20; 2 Chr. 32:3, 4] \x*the old pool. But \x + \xo 22:11 \xt [ch. 5:12]\x*you did not look to him who did it, or see him who planned it long ago.
\b
\q1
\v 12 In that day \x + \xo 22:12 \xt [Joel 2:17] \x*the Lord \nd God\nd* of hosts
\q2 called for weeping and mourning,
\q2 for \x + \xo 22:12 \xt See ch. 3:24 \x*baldness and \x + \xo 22:12 \xt See 2 Sam. 3:31\x*wearing sackcloth;
\q1
\v 13 and behold, joy and gladness,
\q2 killing oxen and slaughtering sheep,
\q2 eating flesh and drinking wine.
\q1 \x + \xo 22:13 \xt ch. 56:12; Cited 1 Cor. 15:32\x*“Let us eat and drink,

\q1
\v 14 The \nd Lord\nd* of hosts \x + \xo 22:14 \xt ch. 5:9 \x*has revealed himself in my ears:
\q1 “Surely \x + \xo 22:14 \xt [ch. 27:9; 1 Sam. 3:14] \x*this iniquity will not be atoned for you \x + \xo 22:14 \xt [ver. 13]\x*until you die,”

\b
\p
\v 15 Thus says the Lord \nd God\nd* of hosts, “Come, go to this steward, to \x + \xo 22:15 \xt ch. 36:3, 11, 22; 37:2; 2 Kgs. 18:18, 26, 37; 19:2\x*Shebna, who is over the household, and say to him:
\v 16 What have you to do here, and whom have you here, \x + \xo 22:16 \xt 2 Chr. 16:14 \x*that you have cut out here a tomb for yourself, you \x + \xo 22:16 \xt Matt. 27:60\x*who cut out a tomb on the height and carve a dwelling for yourself in the rock?
\v 17 Behold, the \nd Lord\nd* will hurl you away violently, O you strong man. \x + \xo 22:17 \xt [Dan. 3:21]\x*He will seize firm hold on you
\v 18 and whirl you around and around, and throw you like a ball into a wide land. There you shall die, and there shall be \x + \xo 22:18 \xt [ch. 36:9]\x*your glorious chariots, you shame of your master’s house.
\v 19 \x + \xo 22:19 \xt [ver. 25]\x*I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station.
\v 20 In that day I will call my servant \x + \xo 22:20 \xt ch. 36:3; 37:2; 2 Kgs. 18:18, 26, 37; 19:2\x*Eliakim the son of Hilkiah,
\v 21 and \x + \xo 22:21 \xt [See ver. 20 above] \x*I will clothe him with your robe, and will bind your sash on him, and will commit your authority to his hand. And he shall be \x + \xo 22:21 \xt Gen. 45:8\x*a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
\v 22 And I will place \x + \xo 22:22 \xt ch. 9:6 \x*on his shoulder \x + \xo 22:22 \xt Rev. 3:7 \x*the key of the house of David. \x + \xo 22:22 \xt [Job 12:14]\x*He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open.
\v 23 And I will fasten him \x + \xo 22:23 \xt [ch. 33:20; 54:2; Eccles. 12:11] \x*like a peg in a secure place, and he will become \x + \xo 22:23 \xt [Rev. 3:21]\x*a throne of honor to his father’s house.
\v 24 And they will hang on him the whole honor of his father’s house, the offspring and issue, every small vessel, from the cups to all the flagons.
\v 25 In that day, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, \x + \xo 22:25 \xt [See ver. 23 above]\x*the peg that was fastened in a secure place will give way, and it will be cut down and fall, and the load that was on it will be cut off, for the \nd Lord\nd* has spoken.”

\v 15 Because you have said, “We have made a covenant with death,

And he stood \x + \xo 36:2 \xt ch. 7:3\x*by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Washer’s Field.
\v 3 And there came out to him \x + \xo 36:3 \xt ch. 22:15, 20, 21\x*Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and \x + \xo 36:3 \xt ch. 22:15, 20, 21\x*Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder.
\p
\v 4 And the Rabshakeh said to them, “Say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says the \x + \xo 36:4 \xt [ch. 10:8]\x*great king, the king of Assyria: On what do you rest this trust of yours?

\v 9 How then can you repulse \x + \xo 36:9 \xt [ch. 10:8] \x*a single captain among the least of my master’s servants, when \x + \xo 36:9 \xt [ch. 20:5; 30:3, 7; 31:1]\x*you trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
\v 10 Moreover, is it without the \nd Lord\nd* that I have come up against this land to destroy it? \x + \xo 36:10 \xt ch. 10:5, 6\x*The \nd Lord\nd* said to me, Go up against this land and destroy it.’”
\p
\v 11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Rabshakeh, “Please speak to your servants \x + \xo 36:11 \xt Ezra 4:7; Dan. 2:4\x*in Aramaic, for we understand it. Do not speak to us in the language of Judah within the hearing of the people who are on the wall.”
\v 12 But the Rabshakeh said, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men sitting on the wall, who are doomed with you to eat their own dung and drink their own urine?”
\p
\v 13 Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out in a loud voice in the language of Judah: “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria!

\p
\v 21 But they were silent and answered him not a word, for the king’s command was, “Do not answer him.”
\v 22 \x + \xo 36:22 \xt ver. 3; [ch. 33:7]\x*Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and Joah the son of Asaph, the recorder, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn, and told him the words of the Rabshakeh.

\v 2 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the secretary, and the senior priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet \x + \xo 37:2 \xt See ch. 1:1\x*Isaiah the son of Amoz.
\v 3 They said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day is a \x + \xo 37:3 \xt [ch. 22:5] \x*day of distress, of rebuke, and of disgrace; \x + \xo 37:3 \xt [ch. 13:8; Hos. 13:13]\x*children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth.

\p
\v 5 When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,
\v 6 Isaiah said to them, “Say to your master, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: Do not be afraid because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me.

\p
\v 8 The Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria fighting against \x + \xo 37:8 \xt Josh. 10:31\x*Libnah, for he had heard that the king had left \x + \xo 37:8 \xt Josh. 10:31\x*Lachish.

\s1 Hezekiah’s Prayer for Deliverance
\p
\v 14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up to the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, and spread it before the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed to the \nd Lord\nd*:
