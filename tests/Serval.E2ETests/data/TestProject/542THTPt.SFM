\s1 Greeting
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1 \xt For ver. 1, 2, see 1 Thess. 1:1\x*Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy,
\p To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\s1 Thanksgiving
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ch. 2:13; See Eph. 5:20; 1 Thess. 1:2, 3\x*We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers,\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church\f* as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.
\v 4 Therefore \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [2 Cor. 7:14]; See 1 Thess. 2:19 \x*we ourselves boast about you \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [1 Thess. 1:8]; See 1 Cor. 7:17 \x*in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [Mark 10:30]; See 1 Thess. 2:14\x*in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring.
\s1 The Judgment at Christ’s Coming
\p
\v 5 This is \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [Phil. 1:28] \x*evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [Acts 14:22]; See Luke 20:35\x*considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering—
\v 6 since indeed God considers it \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Rev. 6:10] \x*just \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Ex. 23:22; Joel 3:4, 7]\x*to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
\v 7 and to grant \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [Rev. 6:11; 11:18; 14:13] \x*relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when \x + \xo 1:7 \xt See Luke 17:30 \x*the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven \x + \xo 1:7 \xt See Jude 14\x*with his mighty angels
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Isa. 66:15, 16; Matt. 25:41; 1 Cor. 3:13; Heb. 10:27; 12:29; 2 Pet. 3:7; [Mal. 4:1] \x*in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those \x + \xo 1:8 \xt See Gal. 4:8 \x*who do not know God and on those who \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Rom. 2:8\x*do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
\v 9 They will suffer the punishment of \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [Phil. 3:19; 1 Thess. 5:3] \x*eternal destruction, \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Isa. 2:10, 19, 21; [ch. 2:8]\x*away from\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Or \fq destruction that comes from\f* the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
\v 10 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt See 1 Thess. 1:10 \x*when he comes on \x + \xo 1:10 \xt See 1 Cor. 3:13 \x*that day \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Ps. 89:7 (Gk.); Isa. 49:3; John 17:10 \x*to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [1 Cor. 1:6] \x*testimony to you \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [1 Thess. 2:1, 13; 1 Tim. 3:16]\x*was believed.
\v 11 To this end we \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Col. 1:9 \x*always pray for you, that our God may \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [ver. 5] \x*make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every \x + \xo 1:11 \xt 1 Thess. 1:3\x*work of faith by his power,
\v 12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [Isa. 66:5; Acts 13:48]\x*may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.

\s1 The Man of Lawlessness
\p \v 1 Now concerning \x + \xo 2:1 \xt See 1 Thess. 2:19 \x*the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [Matt. 24:31; 1 Thess. 4:15-17]\x*being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers,\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 13, 15\f*
\v 2 not to be quickly shaken in mind or \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Matt. 24:6; Mark 13:7 \x*alarmed, either \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [1 John 4:1] \x*by a spirit or a \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ver. 15; [1 Thess. 5:2] \x*spoken word, or \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ver. 15; [1 Thess. 5:2] \x*a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that \x + \xo 2:2 \xt See 1 Cor. 1:8\x*the day of the Lord has come.
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Eph. 5:6 \x*Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, \x + \xo 2:3 \xt 1 Tim. 4:1 \x*unless the rebellion comes first, and \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [ver. 8; Dan. 7:25; 8:25; 11:36; Rev. 13:5, 6] \x*the man of lawlessness\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Some manuscripts \fq sin\f* is revealed, \x + \xo 2:3 \xt John 17:12; [Matt. 23:15]\x*the son of destruction,\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Greek \fq the son of perdition \ft (a Hebrew idiom)\f*
\v 4 who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [Isa. 14:14; Ezek. 28:2]\x*proclaiming himself to be God.
\v 5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
\v 6 And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.
\v 7 For \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Rev. 17:5, 7 \x*the mystery of lawlessness \x + \xo 2:7 \xt 1 John 2:18; 4:3\x*is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.
\v 8 And then \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See ver. 3 \x*the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [Dan. 7:10, 11] \x*will kill with \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Isa. 11:4 \x*the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [1 Tim. 6:14; 2 Tim. 1:10; 4:1, 8; Titus 2:13]\x*the appearance of his coming.
\v 9 The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [Rev. 13:14]; See Matt. 24:24\x*with all power and false signs and wonders,
\v 10 and with all wicked deception for \x + \xo 2:10 \xt See 1 Cor. 1:18\x*those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
\v 11 Therefore \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [1 Kgs. 22:22; Ezek. 14:9; Rev. 17:17] \x*God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [1 Thess. 2:3; 1 Tim. 4:2]; See Rom. 1:25\x*what is false,
\v 12 in order that all may be condemned \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Rom. 2:8 \x*who did not believe the truth but \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See Rom. 1:32\x*had pleasure in unrighteousness.
\s1 Stand Firm
\p
\v 13 But \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ch. 1:3 \x*we ought always to give thanks to God for you, \x + \xo 2:13 \xt 1 Thess. 1:4; [Deut. 33:12] \x*brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Eph. 1:4 \x*as the firstfruits\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Some manuscripts \fq chose you from the beginning\f* \x + \xo 2:13 \xt 1 Thess. 5:9; [2 Tim. 1:9] \x*to be saved, \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See 1 Thess. 4:3\x*through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.
\v 14 To this he called you through \x + \xo 2:14 \xt 1 Thess. 1:5 \x*our gospel, \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [See ver. 13 above]\x*so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 15 So then, brothers, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt See 1 Cor. 16:13 \x*stand firm and hold to \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ch. 3:6; 1 Cor. 11:2 \x*the traditions that you were taught by us, either \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ver. 2\x*by our spoken word or by \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ver. 2\x*our letter.
\p
\v 16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, \x + \xo 2:16 \xt John 3:16; 1 John 4:10; Rev. 1:5 \x*who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good \x + \xo 2:16 \xt 1 Pet. 1:3\x*hope through grace,
\v 17 comfort your hearts and \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ch. 3:3; 1 Thess. 3:13\x*establish them in every good work and word.
\c 3
\s1 Pray for Us
\p \v 1 Finally, brothers,\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 6, 13\f* \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See 1 Thess. 5:25 \x*pray for us, that \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Ps. 147:15; [1 Thess. 1:8]\x*the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored,\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Or \fq glorified\f* as happened among you,
\v 2 and \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Rom. 15:31 \x*that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men. For \x + \xo 3:2 \xt [Deut. 32:20]\x*not all have faith.
\v 3 But \x + \xo 3:3 \xt See 1 Cor. 1:9 \x*the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Matt. 6:13; John 17:15 \x*guard you against \x + \xo 3:3 \xt See Matt. 13:19\x*the evil one.\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or \fq evil\f*
\v 4 And \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See 2 Cor. 2:3\x*we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command.
\v 5 May the Lord \x + \xo 3:5 \xt 1 Thess. 3:11\x*direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.
\s1 Warning Against Idleness
\p
\v 6 Now we command you, brothers, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt 1 Cor. 5:4 \x*in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ver. 14; [Matt. 18:17; 2 Tim. 3:5]; See 1 Cor. 5:9; 2 John 10 \x*that you keep away from any \x + \xo 3:6 \xt 1 Cor. 5:11 \x*brother \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ver. 11; 1 Thess. 5:14\x*who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.
\v 7 For you yourselves know \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [Acts 20:35]; See 1 Thess. 1:6 \x*how you ought to imitate us, because \x + \xo 3:7 \xt 1 Thess. 1:5\x*we were not idle when we were with you,
\v 8 nor did we eat anyone’s bread without paying for it, but \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See 1 Thess. 2:9\x*with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.
\v 9 It was \x + \xo 3:9 \xt 1 Cor. 9:4; 1 Thess. 2:6 \x*not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves \x + \xo 3:9 \xt ver. 7; 1 Pet. 5:3\x*an example to imitate.
\v 10 For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [Gen. 3:19]; See 1 Thess. 4:11\x*If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
\v 11 For we hear that some among you \x + \xo 3:11 \xt ver. 6 \x*walk in idleness, not busy at work, but \x + \xo 3:11 \xt 1 Tim. 5:13; 1 Pet. 4:15\x*busybodies.
\v 12 Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.\f + \fr 3:12 \ft Greek \fq to eat their own bread\f*
\p
\v 13 As for you, brothers, \x + \xo 3:13 \xt Gal. 6:9; [1 Cor. 15:58]\x*do not grow weary in doing good.
\v 14 If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and \x + \xo 3:14 \xt See ver. 6\x*have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.
\v 15 \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See Lev. 19:17; Matt. 18:15 \x*Do not regard him as an enemy, but \x + \xo 3:15 \xt 1 Thess. 5:12, 14; [Titus 3:10]\x*warn him as a brother.
\s1 Benediction
\p
\v 16 Now may \x + \xo 3:16 \xt See Rom. 15:33; Eph. 6:23 \x*the Lord of peace himself \x + \xo 3:16 \xt Num. 6:26 \x*give you peace at all times in every way. \x + \xo 3:16 \xt Ruth 2:4\x*The Lord be with you all.
\p
\v 17 I, Paul, write \x + \xo 3:17 \xt See 1 Cor. 16:21\x*this greeting with my own hand. This is the sign of genuineness in every letter of mine; it is the way I write.
\v 18 \x + \xo 3:18 \xt See Rom. 16:20\x*The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
