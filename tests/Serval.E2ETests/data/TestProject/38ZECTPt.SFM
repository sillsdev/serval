\s1 A Call to Return to the \nd Lord\nd*
\p
\v 1 In the eighth month, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See Hag. 1:1 \x*in the second year of Darius, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to the prophet \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Ezra 6:14; Matt. 23:35 \x*Zechariah, the son of \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Chr. 6:39 \x*Berechiah, son of \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Neh. 12:4, 16\x*Iddo, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [Jer. 2:5]\x*“The \nd Lord\nd* was very angry with your fathers.
\v 3 Therefore say to them, Thus declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Isa. 31:6; Jer. 3:1, 22; Ezek. 18:30; Mal. 3:7 \x*Return to me, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Jer. 12:15; Mic. 7:19\x*I will return to you, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [Ps. 78:8] \x*Do not be like your fathers, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See 2 Chr. 36:15 \x*to whom the former prophets cried out, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds.’ But \x + \xo 1:4 \xt ch. 7:11; 2 Chr. 36:16; See Jer. 35:15\x*they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 5 Your fathers, where are they? And \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [John 8:52]\x*the prophets, do they live forever?
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Isa. 40:8; Matt. 24:35] \x*But my words and my statutes, which I commanded \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Dan. 9:6 \x*my servants the prophets, did they not \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Deut. 28:2, 15 \x*overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Lam. 2:17 \x*‘As the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts purposed to deal with us for \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Ezek. 36:31]\x*our ways and \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Ezek. 36:31]\x*deeds, so has he dealt with us.’”
\s1 A Vision of a Horseman
\p
\v 7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to the prophet \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*Zechariah, the son of \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*Berechiah, son of \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*Iddo, saying,
\v 8 “I saw in the night, and behold, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Rev. 6:4] \x*a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Rev. 6:4, 5, 8]; See ch. 6:2-7\x*red, sorrel, and white horses.
\v 9 Then I said, ‘What are these, my lord?’ \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [Rev. 22:6]\x*The angel who talked with me said to me, ‘I will show you what they are.’
\v 10 So \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [See ver. 8 above] \x*the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Heb. 1:14] \x*‘These are they whom the \nd Lord\nd* has sent to \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 6:7; [Job 1:7]\x*patrol the earth.’
\v 11 And they answered \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [See ver. 10 above] \x*‘We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [ver. 15]\x*remains at rest.’
\v 12 Then \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* said, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Ps. 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 2:6; Rev. 6:10 \x*‘O \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Ps. 80:4; 89:46; Hab. 2:6; Rev. 6:10 \x*how long will you \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Ps. 102:13 \x*have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ch. 7:5; Jer. 25:11; 29:10\x*seventy years?’
\v 13 And the \nd Lord\nd* answered \x + \xo 1:13 \xt See Jer. 29:10, 11 \x*gracious and comforting words to \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [See ver. 9 above]\x*the angel who talked with me.
\v 14 So \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*the angel who talked with me said to me, ‘Cry out, Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 1:14 \xt ch. 8:2; Joel 2:18\x*I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Joel 3:2] \x*And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [ver. 11] \x*at ease; \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Isa. 54:7, 8] \x*for while I was angry but a little, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Isa. 47:6]\x*they furthered the disaster.
\v 16 Therefore, thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 8:3 \x*I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; \x + \xo 1:16 \xt [ch. 4:9; Ezra 6:14] \x*my house shall be built in it, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, and \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Jer. 31:39; Ezek. 40:3; 47:3\x*the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem.
\v 17 Cry out again, Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 2:4 \x*My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Isa. 40:1; 51:3 \x*and the \nd Lord\nd* will again comfort Zion and again \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 2:12\x*choose Jerusalem.’”
\s1 A Vision of Horns and Craftsmen
\p
\v 18 \f + \fr 1:18 \ft Ch 2:1 in Hebrew\f* And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, \x + \xo 1:18 \xt [1 Kgs. 22:11]\x*four horns!
\v 19 And I said to \x + \xo 1:19 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*the angel who talked with me, “What are these?” And he said to me, \x + \xo 1:19 \xt [See ver. 18 above]\x*“These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
\v 20 Then the \nd Lord\nd* showed me four craftsmen.
\v 21 And I said, “What are these coming to do?” He said, \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [See ver. 18 above] \x*“These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one raised his head. And these have come \x + \xo 1:21 \xt Deut. 28:26; Jer. 7:33 \x*to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [Ps. 75:4, 5]\x*who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it.”

\s1 A Vision of a Man with a Measuring Line
\p
\v 1 \f + \fr 2:1 \ft Ch 2:5 in Hebrew\f* And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Ezek. 40:3; Rev. 11:1\x*a man with a measuring line in his hand!
\v 2 Then I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [ch. 1:16]\x*“To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length.”
\v 3 And behold, \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 1:9, 19\x*the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him
\v 4 and said to him, “Run, say to that young man, \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [ch. 12:6; 14:10, 11] \x*‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See Esth. 9:19 \x*as villages without walls, because of \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Isa. 49:19; Jer. 31:27\x*the multitude of people and livestock in it.
\v 5 And I will be to her \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Isa. 4:5; [ch. 9:8; Ps. 125:2]\x*a wall of fire all around, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, and I will be the glory in her midst.’”
\p
\v 6 Up! Up! \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Isa. 48:20 \x*Flee from the land of the north, declares the \nd Lord\nd*. For I have \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [ch. 7:14; Ezek. 5:10; 17:21]\x*spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [Isa. 52:11]\x*Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.
\v 8 For thus said the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, after his glory sent me\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or \fq he sent me after glory\f* to the nations who plundered you, \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Jer. 12:14 \x*for he who touches you touches \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See Deut. 32:10\x*the apple of his eye:
\v 9 “Behold, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Isa. 11:15; 19:16 \x*I will shake my hand over them, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Ezek. 39:10 \x*and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ch. 4:9; 6:15; Ezek. 33:33\x*you will know that the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has sent me.
\v 10 \x + \xo 2:10 \xt See Zeph. 3:14 \x*Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Ps. 40:7 \x*behold, I come \x + \xo 2:10 \xt ch. 8:3; Isa. 12:6; Ezek. 37:27; Zeph. 3:15; 2 Cor. 6:16; See Lev. 26:12\x*and I will dwell in your midst, declares the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 8:22; See Isa. 2:2 \x*And many nations shall join themselves to the \nd Lord\nd* in that day, and shall be my people. \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [See ver. 10 above] \x*And I will dwell in your midst, and \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [See ver. 9 above]\x*you shall know that the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has sent me to you.
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See Deut. 32:9 \x*And the \nd Lord\nd* will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ch. 1:17; [Hab. 2:20]\x*choose Jerusalem.”
\p
\v 13 Be silent, all flesh, before the \nd Lord\nd*, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling.

\s1 A Vision of Joshua the High Priest
\p
\v 1 Then he showed me \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ch. 6:11; See Ezra 3:2 \x*Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the \nd Lord\nd*, and \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [1 Chr. 21:1; Ps. 109:6]\x*Satan\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Hebrew \fq the Accuser \ft or \fq the Adversary\f* standing at his right hand to accuse him.
\v 2 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Satan, \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Jude 9 \x*“The \nd Lord\nd* rebuke you, O Satan! The \nd Lord\nd* who has \x + \xo 3:2 \xt ch. 1:17; [Rom. 8:33] \x*chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Amos 4:11\x*a brand\f + \fr 3:2 \ft That is, a burning stick\f* plucked from the fire?”
\v 3 Now \x + \xo 3:3 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*Joshua was standing before the angel, \x + \xo 3:3 \xt [Isa. 64:6; Jude 23]\x*clothed with filthy garments.
\v 4 And the angel said to \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [ver. 7; Luke 1:19] \x*those who were standing before him, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Rev. 7:14 \x*“Remove the filthy garments from him.” And to him he said, “Behold, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [ver. 9; Isa. 6:7] \x*I have taken your iniquity away from you, and \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Isa. 61:10; Luke 15:22; Rev. 19:8\x*I will clothe you with pure vestments.”
\v 5 And I said, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Job 29:14; [ch. 6:11]\x*“Let them put a clean turban on his head.” So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* was standing by.
\p
\v 6 And the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* solemnly assured \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*Joshua,
\v 7 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Gen. 26:5; Mal. 3:14; See Lev. 8:35 \x*keep my charge, then you shall \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [Deut. 17:9; Mal. 2:7] \x*rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [ver. 4]\x*those who are standing here.
\v 8 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [Ezek. 12:11] \x*they are men who are a sign: behold, I will bring \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Isa. 42:1 \x*my servant \x + \xo 3:8 \xt ch. 6:12; Isa. 11:1; See Jer. 23:5\x*the Branch.
\v 9 For behold, on \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Ps. 118:22; Isa. 28:16; [ch. 4:7]; See Ezra 3:9-11 \x*the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with \x + \xo 3:9 \xt ch. 4:10; Rev. 5:6 \x*seven eyes,\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Or \fq facets\f* I will \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [2 Tim. 2:19] \x*engrave its inscription, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, and \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [ver. 4]\x*I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day.
\v 10 In that day, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See 1 Kgs. 4:25\x*under his vine and under his fig tree.”

\s1 A Vision of a Golden Lampstand
\p
\v 1 And \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 1:9, 19 \x*the angel who talked with me came again \x + \xo 4:1 \xt Dan. 8:18; 10:9, 10\x*and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep.
\v 2 And he said to me, “What do you see?” I said, “I see, and behold, \x + \xo 4:2 \xt See Ex. 25:31 \x*a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and \x + \xo 4:2 \xt Ex. 25:37; [Rev. 1:12; 4:5]\x*seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it.
\v 3 And there are \x + \xo 4:3 \xt [ver. 11; Rev. 11:4]\x*two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
\v 4 And I said to \x + \xo 4:4 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
\v 5 Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, \x + \xo 4:5 \xt ver. 12\x*“Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”
\v 6 Then he said to me, “This is the word of the \nd Lord\nd* to \x + \xo 4:6 \xt See 1 Chr. 3:19 \x*Zerubbabel: \x + \xo 4:6 \xt [Hos. 1:7]\x*Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 7 Who are you, \x + \xo 4:7 \xt [Jer. 51:25] \x*O great mountain? Before \x + \xo 4:7 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*Zerubbabel \x + \xo 4:7 \xt Isa. 40:4 \x*you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward \x + \xo 4:7 \xt See ch. 3:9\x*the top stone amid shouts of ‘Grace, grace to it!’”
\p
\v 8 Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me, saying,
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9 \xt [Ezra 3:10] \x*“The hands of \x + \xo 4:9 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also \x + \xo 4:9 \xt [ch. 1:16] \x*complete it. \x + \xo 4:9 \xt See ch. 2:9\x*Then you will know that the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts has sent me to you.
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10 \xt [Hag. 2:3] \x*For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see \x + \xo 4:10 \xt [ch. 1:16] \x*the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel.
\p \x + \xo 4:10 \xt ch. 3:9 \x*“These seven \x + \xo 4:10 \xt ch. 3:9 \x*are the eyes of the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 4:10 \xt 2 Chr. 16:9; [Prov. 15:3]\x*which range through the whole earth.”
\v 11 Then I said to him, “What are these \x + \xo 4:11 \xt [See ver. 3 above]\x*two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand?”
\v 12 And a second time I answered and said to him, “What are these \x + \xo 4:12 \xt [See ver. 3 above]\x*two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil\f + \fr 4:12 \ft Hebrew lacks \fq oil\f* is poured out?”
\v 13 He said to me, \x + \xo 4:13 \xt ver. 5\x*“Do you not know what these are?” I said, “No, my lord.”
\v 14 Then he said, \x + \xo 4:14 \xt Rev. 11:4 \x*“These are the two anointed ones\f + \fr 4:14 \ft Hebrew \fq two sons of new oil\f* who stand by \x + \xo 4:14 \xt ch. 6:5\x*the Lord of the whole earth.”
\c 5
\s1 A Vision of a Flying Scroll
\p
\v 1 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Jer. 36:2, 28\x*scroll!
\v 2 And he said to me, “What do you see?” I answered, “I see a flying \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits.”\f + \fr 5:2 \ft A \fq cubit \ft was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters\f*
\v 3 Then he said to me, “This is \x + \xo 5:3 \xt [Jer. 29:18; Ezek. 2:9, 10]; See Deut. 29:27 \x*the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land. For everyone who \x + \xo 5:3 \xt See Ex. 20:15 \x*steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side, and everyone who \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Ex. 20:7; [Eccles. 5:2]\x*swears falsely\f + \fr 5:3 \ft Hebrew lacks \fq falsely \ft (supplied from verse 4)\f* shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side.
\v 4 I will send it out, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of \x + \xo 5:4 \xt ch. 8:17; Lev. 19:12; Mal. 3:5 \x*him who swears falsely by my name.

\s1 A Vision of a Woman in a Basket
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5 \xt ch. 1:9 \x*Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [ver. 1, 9; ch. 6:1]\x*“Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out.”
\v 6 And I said, “What is it?” He said, “This is \x + \xo 5:6 \xt [Ezek. 45:11]\x*the basket\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Hebrew \+tl ephah\+tl*; also verses 7–11. An \+tl ephah\+tl* was about 3/5 bushel or 22 liters\f* that is going out.” And he said, “This is their iniquity\f + \fr 5:6 \ft One Hebrew manuscript, Septuagint, Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts \fq eye\f* in all the land.”
\v 7 And behold, the leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the basket!
\v 8 And he said, “This is Wickedness.” And he thrust her back into the basket, and thrust down \x + \xo 5:8 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*the leaden weight on its opening.
\p
\v 9 Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, two women coming forward! \x + \xo 5:9 \xt [Hos. 4:19]\x*The wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven.
\v 10 Then I said to the angel who talked with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
\v 11 He said to me, “To the \x + \xo 5:11 \xt See Gen. 11:2\x*land of Shinar, to build a house for it. And when this is prepared, they will set the basket down there on its base.”

\s1 A Vision of Four Chariots
\p
\v 1 Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of \x + \xo 6:1 \xt Dan. 2:39\x*bronze.
\v 2 The first chariot had \x + \xo 6:2 \xt ch. 1:8; Rev. 6:4 \x*red horses, the second \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Rev. 6:5\x*black horses,
\v 3 the third \x + \xo 6:3 \xt ch. 1:8; Rev. 6:2\x*white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses—all of them strong.\f + \fr 6:3 \ft Or \fq and the fourth chariot strong dappled horses\f*
\v 4 Then I answered and said to \x + \xo 6:4 \xt ch. 1:9\x*the angel who talked with me, “What are these, my lord?”
\v 5 And the angel answered and said to me, \x + \xo 6:5 \xt Ps. 104:4; Heb. 1:7 \x*“These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after \x + \xo 6:5 \xt ch. 3:4 \x*presenting themselves before \x + \xo 6:5 \xt ch. 4:14\x*the Lord of all the earth.
\v 6 The chariot with the black horses goes toward \x + \xo 6:6 \xt ver. 8; ch. 2:6; Jer. 1:13 \x*the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward \x + \xo 6:6 \xt [ch. 9:14]\x*the south country.”
\v 7 When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and \x + \xo 6:7 \xt [ch. 1:10]\x*patrol the earth. And he said, “Go, \x + \xo 6:7 \xt [ch. 1:10]\x*patrol the earth.” \x + \xo 6:7 \xt [ch. 1:10]\x*So they patrolled the earth.
\v 8 Then he cried to me, “Behold, those who go toward \x + \xo 6:8 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*the north country have set my Spirit at rest in \x + \xo 6:8 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*the north country.”
\s1 The Crown and the Temple
\p
\v 9 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me:

\s1 A Call for Justice and Mercy
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 7:1 \xt [ch. 1:1, 7] \x*In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Neh. 1:1\x*Chislev.
\v 2 Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men \x + \xo 7:2 \xt ch. 8:21, 22; 1 Sam. 13:12; Mal. 1:9\x*to entreat the favor of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\v 3 \x + \xo 7:3 \xt Mal. 2:7 \x*saying to the priests of the house of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts and \x + \xo 7:3 \xt ch. 8:9; [Ezra 5:1; 6:14] \x*the prophets, “Should I weep and \x + \xo 7:3 \xt [ch. 12:12] \x*abstain in \x + \xo 7:3 \xt ch. 8:19; [2 Kgs. 25:8]\x*the fifth month, as I have done for so many years?”
\p
\v 4 Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts came to me:
\v 5 “Say to all the people of the land and the priests, When you fasted and mourned in \x + \xo 7:5 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*the fifth month and in \x + \xo 7:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 25:25] \x*the seventh, for these \x + \xo 7:5 \xt See ch. 1:12 \x*seventy years, \x + \xo 7:5 \xt [Isa. 58:4, 5]\x*was it \x + \xo 7:5 \xt [Isa. 58:4, 5]\x*for me that you fasted?

\p
\v 8 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Zechariah, saying,
\v 9 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, \x + \xo 7:9 \xt Isa. 1:17; Jer. 21:12; Mic. 6:8; [Matt. 23:23]\x*Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another,

\v 11 But \x + \xo 7:11 \xt ch. 1:4 \x*they refused to pay attention \x + \xo 7:11 \xt Neh. 9:29\x*and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear.\f + \fr 7:11 \ft Hebrew \fq and made their ears too heavy to hear\f*

\s1 The Coming Peace and Prosperity of Zion
\p
\v 1 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts came, saying,

\v 6 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 8:6 \xt [Ps. 118:23] \x*If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, \x + \xo 8:6 \xt See Gen. 18:14\x*should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts?
\v 7 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: Behold, \x + \xo 8:7 \xt ch. 10:6 \x*I will save my people \x + \xo 8:7 \xt Ps. 107:3; Isa. 43:5; [Isa. 49:12; Ezek. 37:21]\x*from the east country and from the west country,

\p
\v 9 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 8:9 \xt 2 Sam. 16:21; [Hag. 2:4] \x*“Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of \x + \xo 8:9 \xt ch. 7:3; Ezra 5:1, 2 \x*the prophets who were present on \x + \xo 8:9 \xt Hag. 2:18\x*the day that the foundation of the house of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.
\v 10 For before those days \x + \xo 8:10 \xt [Hag. 1:6]\x*there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor.
\v 11 But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12 \xt Hos. 2:21, 22; Hag. 2:19 \x*For there shall be a sowing of peace.

\v 13 And as \x + \xo 8:13 \xt [Isa. 43:28; 65:15] \x*you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, \x + \xo 8:13 \xt ch. 10:6 \x*so will I save you, and \x + \xo 8:13 \xt See Gen. 12:2, 3 \x*you shall be a blessing. \x + \xo 8:13 \xt Hag. 2:5 \x*Fear not, but \x + \xo 8:13 \xt [See ver. 9 above]\x*let your hands be strong.”
\p
\v 14 For thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: \x + \xo 8:14 \xt [Jer. 31:28; 32:42]\x*“As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,

\p
\v 18 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts came to me, saying,
\v 19 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: The fast of the \x + \xo 8:19 \xt [Jer. 39:2] \x*fourth month and the fast of the \x + \xo 8:19 \xt ch. 7:3 \x*fifth and the fast of the \x + \xo 8:19 \xt ch. 7:5 \x*seventh and the fast of the \x + \xo 8:19 \xt 2 Kgs. 25:1 \x*tenth shall be to the house of Judah \x + \xo 8:19 \xt Isa. 35:10 \x*seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts.

\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 11:7 \xt [ver. 4] \x*So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named \x + \xo 11:7 \xt ver. 10 \x*Favor, the other I named \x + \xo 11:7 \xt ver. 14\x*Union. \x + \xo 11:7 \xt [ver. 4] \x*And I tended the sheep.
