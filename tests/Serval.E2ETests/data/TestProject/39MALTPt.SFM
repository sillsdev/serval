\s1 The \nd Lord\nd*’s Love for Israel
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Deut. 7:8; Jer. 31:3 \x*“I have loved you,” says the \nd Lord\nd*. \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [ch. 2:14, 17; 3:7, 8, 13] \x*But you say, “How have you loved us?” “Is not Esau \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [Amos 1:11; Obad. 10] \x*Jacob’s brother?” declares the \nd Lord\nd*. “Yet \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Cited Rom. 9:13\x*I have loved Jacob
\v 3 but Esau I have hated. \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Isa. 34:13; Jer. 49:10, 18; Ezek. 35:3, 4; Joel 3:19\x*I have laid waste his hill country and left his heritage to jackals of the desert.”
\v 4 If Edom says, “We are shattered but we will rebuild the ruins,” the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts says, “They may build, but I will tear down, and they will be called ‘the wicked country,’ and ‘the people with whom the \nd Lord\nd* is angry forever.’”
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Ps. 91:8\x*Your own eyes shall see this, and you shall say, “Great is the \nd Lord\nd* beyond the border of Israel!”
\s1 The Priests’ Polluted Offerings
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Ex. 20:12 \x*“A son honors his father, and a servant his master. If then I am \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Ex. 4:22; Hos. 11:1 \x*a father, where is my honor? And if I am \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Luke 6:46] \x*a master, where is my fear? says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts to you, O priests, who despise my name. \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [See ver. 2 above]\x*But you say, ‘How have we despised your name?’
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [ver. 8; ch. 2:12; 3:3] \x*By offering polluted food upon my altar. \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*But you say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ By saying that \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [ver. 12]\x*the \nd Lord\nd*’s table may be despised.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [ver. 13]; See Lev. 22:22\x*When you offer blind animals in sacrifice, is that not evil? And when you offer those that are lame or sick, is that not evil? Present that to your governor; will he accept you or show you favor? says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 9 And now \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See Zech. 7:2 \x*entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious to us. With such a gift from your hand, \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See Deut. 10:17\x*will he show favor to any of you? says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 10 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Isa. 1:13] \x*Oh that there were one among you who would shut the doors, that you might not kindle fire on my altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Isa. 1:11; Jer. 6:20; Amos 5:21]\x*and I will not accept an offering from your hand.
\v 11 For from the rising of the sun to its setting my name \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [Isa. 2:2; 56:7; 60:3; 66:19]\x*will be\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or \fq is \ft (three times in verse 11; also verse 14)\f* great among the nations, and in every place incense will be offered to my name, and a pure offering. For my name \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [Isa. 2:2; 56:7; 60:3; 66:19]\x*will be great among the nations, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 12 But you profane it when you say that \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [ver. 7]\x*the Lord’s table is polluted, and its fruit, that is, its food may be despised.
\v 13 But you say, \x + \xo 1:13 \xt Isa. 43:23; [ch. 3:14; Mic. 6:3] \x*‘What a weariness this is,’ and you snort at it, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts. \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [ver. 8; Lev. 22:20]\x*You bring what has been taken by violence or is lame or sick, and this you bring as your offering! Shall I accept that from your hand? says the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 14 Cursed be the cheat who has \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See Ex. 12:5 \x*a male in his flock, and \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [Lev. 22:21] \x*vows it, and yet sacrifices to the Lord what is blemished. For \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See Zech. 14:9 \x*I am a great King, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, and my name \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Ps. 47:2; 76:12\x*will be feared among the nations.

\s1 The \nd Lord\nd* Rebukes the Priests
\p
\v 1 “And now, \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ch. 1:6 \x*O priests, \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ver. 4\x*this command is for you.
\v 2 \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Lev. 26:14; See Deut. 28:15 \x*If you will not listen, if you will not take it to heart to give honor to my name, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, then I will send \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [ch. 3:9] \x*the curse upon you and I will curse \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [Ps. 69:22]\x*your blessings. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you do not lay it to heart.
\v 3 Behold, \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Joel 1:17; Hag. 2:17] \x*I will rebuke your offspring,\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Hebrew \fq seed\f* and \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Nah. 3:6 \x*spread dung on your faces, the \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Ex. 29:14]\x*dung of your offerings, and you shall be taken away with it.\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Or \fq to it\f*
\v 4 So shall you know that I have sent \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ver. 1 \x*this command to you, that \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ver. 8; Num. 25:12, 13; Neh. 13:29; [Num. 3:45]\x*my covenant with Levi may stand, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 5 My covenant with him was one of life and \x + \xo 2:5 \xt See Isa. 54:10 \x*peace, and I gave them to him. \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [Lev. 16:2]\x*It was a covenant of fear, and he feared me. He stood in awe of my name.
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Deut. 33:10] \x*True instruction\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Or \fq law\ft ; also verses 7, 8, 9\f* was in his mouth, and no wrong was found on his lips. He walked with me in peace and uprightness, and he \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Dan. 12:3; James 5:20]\x*turned many from iniquity.
\v 7 For \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Deut. 17:9; See Lev. 10:11\x*the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Hebrew \fq they\f* should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 8 But you have turned aside from the way. \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [1 Sam. 2:17; Jer. 18:15; Ezek. 22:26] \x*You have caused many to stumble by your instruction. You have corrupted \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See ver. 4\x*the covenant of Levi, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts,
\v 9 and so \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [1 Sam. 2:30] \x*I make you despised and abased before all the people, inasmuch as you do not keep my ways but \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Deut. 1:17; 16:19\x*show partiality in your instruction.”
\s1 Judah Profaned the Covenant
\p
\v 10 Have we not all \x + \xo 2:10 \xt 1 Cor. 8:6; Eph. 4:6 \x*one Father? Has not \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Acts 17:26 \x*one God created us? Why then are we \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [Isa. 21:2; 24:16; 33:1]\x*faithless to one another, profaning the covenant of our fathers?
\v 11 Judah has been \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [See ver. 10 above] \x*faithless, and abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem. For \x + \xo 2:11 \xt See Ezra 9:2\x*Judah has profaned the sanctuary of the \nd Lord\nd*, which he loves, and has married the daughter of a foreign god.
\v 12 May the \nd Lord\nd* cut off from the tents of Jacob any descendant\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Hebrew \fq any who wakes and answers\f* of the man who does this, who \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [ch. 1:7]\x*brings an offering to the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts!
\p
\v 13 And this second thing you do. \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Zech. 7:3]\x*You cover the \nd Lord\nd*’s altar with tears, with weeping and groaning because he no longer regards the offering or accepts it with favor from your hand.
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [ch. 1:2] \x*But you say, “Why does he not?” Because the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 2:14 \xt ch. 3:5 \x*was witness between you and the wife of your youth, \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [ver. 11; Isa. 54:6] \x*to whom \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [See ver. 10 above]\x*you have been faithless, though she is your companion and your wife by covenant.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Matt. 19:4, 5; See Gen. 2:24 \x*Did he not make them one, with a portion of the Spirit in their union?\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Hebrew \fq in it\f* And what was the one God\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Hebrew \fq the one\f* seeking?\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Or \fq And not one has done this who has a portion of the Spirit. And what was that one seeking?\f* \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [Ezra 9:2] \x*Godly offspring. So guard yourselves\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Or \fq So take care\ft ; also verse 16\f* in your spirit, and let none of you be \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [See ver. 10 above]\x*faithless to the wife of your youth.
\v 16 “For \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:9, 11; Luke 16:18; 1 Cor. 7:10 \x*the man who does not love his wife but divorces her,\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebrew \fq who hates and divorces\f* says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, covers\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Probable meaning (compare Septuagint and Deuteronomy 24:1–4); or \fq “The \+bdit Lord\+bdit*\fq , the God of Israel, says that he hates divorce, and him who covers\f* his garment with violence, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and \x + \xo 2:16 \xt [See ver. 10 above]\x*do not be faithless.”
\s1 The Messenger of the \nd Lord\nd*
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Isa. 43:24 \x*You have wearied the \nd Lord\nd* with your words. \x + \xo 2:17 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*But you say, “How have we wearied him?” \x + \xo 2:17 \xt [ch. 3:15; Isa. 5:20] \x*By saying, “Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the \nd Lord\nd*, and he delights in them.” Or by asking, \x + \xo 2:17 \xt [ch. 3:1; 2 Pet. 3:4]\x*“Where is the God of justice?”
\c 3
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Cited Matt. 11:10; Mark 1:2; Luke 7:27; [ch. 4:5; Luke 1:76] \x*“Behold, I send \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See ch. 2:7 \x*my messenger, and \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See Isa. 40:3 \x*he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [ch. 2:17] \x*whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [ch. 4:5]\x*the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 2 But \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Joel 2:11 \x*who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Isa. 4:4\x*he is like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap.
\v 3 He will sit \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Isa. 1:25; Zech. 13:9 \x*as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring \x + \xo 3:3 \xt [ch. 1:7]\x*offerings in righteousness to the \nd Lord\nd*.\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or \fq and they will belong to the \+bdit Lord\+bdit*\fq , bringers of an offering in righteousness\f*
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Ezek. 20:40\x*Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the \nd Lord\nd* as in the days of old and as in former years.
\p
\v 5 “Then I will draw near to you for judgment. I will be \x + \xo 3:5 \xt ch. 2:14; Jer. 29:23 \x*a swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See Lev. 19:13 \x*who oppress the hired worker in his wages, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See Deut. 24:17\x*the widow and the fatherless, against those who thrust aside the sojourner, and do not fear me, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\s1 Robbing God
\p
\v 6 “For \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Ps. 102:27; See Num. 23:19 \x*I the \nd Lord\nd* do not change; \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Lam. 3:22\x*therefore you, O children of Jacob, are not consumed.
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Acts 7:51 \x*From the days of your fathers you have turned aside from my statutes and have not kept them. \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See Zech. 1:3 \x*Return to me, and I will return to you, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts. \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [ch. 1:2]\x*But you say, ‘How shall we return?’
\v 8 Will man rob God? Yet you are robbing me. \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [See ver. 7 above] \x*But you say, ‘How have we robbed you?’ \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [Neh. 13:10]\x*In your tithes and contributions.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [ch. 2:2]\x*You are cursed with a curse, for you are robbing me, the whole nation of you.
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [Prov. 3:9, 10] \x*Bring the full tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. And thereby \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See 2 Cor. 9:6-8 \x*put me to the test, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, if I will not open \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See Gen. 7:11\x*the windows of heaven for you and pour down for you a blessing until there is no more need.
\v 11 I will rebuke \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [Joel 1:4]\x*the devourer\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Probably a name for some crop-destroying pest or pests\f* for you, so that it will not destroy the fruits of your soil, and your vine in the field shall not fail to bear, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\v 12 Then \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Zeph. 3:19 \x*all nations will call you blessed, for you will be \x + \xo 3:12 \xt [Isa. 62:4]\x*a land of delight, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts.
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [ch. 2:17] \x*“Your words have been hard against me, says the \nd Lord\nd*. \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [ch. 1:2]\x*But you say, ‘How have we spoken against you?’
\v 14 You have said, \x + \xo 3:14 \xt [Zeph. 1:12] \x*‘It is vain to serve God. \x + \xo 3:14 \xt [Job 21:15]\x*What is the profit of our keeping his charge or of walking as in mourning before the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts?

\s1 The Book of Remembrance
\p
\v 16 Then those who feared the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 3:16 \xt [Deut. 6:6, 7] \x*spoke with one another. The \nd Lord\nd* paid attention and heard them, and \x + \xo 3:16 \xt See Ex. 32:32\x*a book of remembrance was written before him of those who feared the \nd Lord\nd* and esteemed his name.
\v 17 “They shall be mine, says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt [ch. 4:3; Acts 17:31] \x*in the day when I make up \x + \xo 3:17 \xt Ex. 19:5; 1 Pet. 2:9\x*my treasured possession, and I will spare them as a man spares his son who serves him.
