\s1 Greeting
\p \v 1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ,
\p To those who are elect exiles of \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See James 1:1\x*the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
\v 2 according to \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Acts 2:23; [Rom. 8:29; 11:2] \x*the foreknowledge of God the Father, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See 1 Thess. 4:3 \x*in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Heb. 10:22; 12:24 \x*for sprinkling with his blood:
\p May \x + \xo 1:2 \xt 2 Pet. 1:2 \x*grace and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Dan. 4:1; Jude 2\x*peace be multiplied to you.
\s1 Born Again to a Living Hope
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt 2 Cor. 1:3; Eph. 1:3 \x*Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Titus 3:5 \x*According to his great mercy, \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ver. 23 \x*he has caused us to be born again to a living hope \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ch. 3:21; [1 Cor. 15:20]\x*through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
\v 4 to \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Rom. 8:17 \x*an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [ch. 5:4] \x*unfading, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [Col. 1:5; 2 Tim. 4:8]\x*kept in heaven for you,
\v 5 who by God’s power are being guarded \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Eph. 2:8 \x*through faith for a salvation \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [ch. 5:10; Rom. 8:18; 2 Cor. 4:17; Heb. 12:11]\x*ready to be revealed in the last time.
\v 6 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by \x + \xo 1:6 \xt James 1:2; [ch. 4:12]\x*various trials,
\v 7 so that \x + \xo 1:7 \xt James 1:3 \x*the tested genuineness of your faith—more precious than gold that perishes \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Job 23:10; Ps. 66:10; Prov. 17:3; Isa. 48:10 \x*though it is tested by \x + \xo 1:7 \xt 1 Cor. 3:13 \x*fire—may be found to result in \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Rom. 2:7, 10; 1 Cor. 4:5; [2 Thess. 1:7-12]\x*praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [1 John 4:20] \x*Though you have not seen him, you love him. \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Heb. 11:27]; See John 20:29\x*Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
\v 9 obtaining \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Rom. 6:22\x*the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
\p
\v 10 Concerning this salvation, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt 2 Pet. 1:19; [Dan. 8:15; Matt. 13:17; Luke 10:24]\x*the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
\v 11 inquiring \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Dan. 9:24-26 \x*what person or time \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Rom. 8:9; [2 Pet. 1:21]; See Acts 16:7 \x*the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating \x + \xo 1:11 \xt See Matt. 26:24 \x*when he predicted \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Isa. 52:13–53:12; Luke 24:26; Acts 3:18\x*the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
\v 12 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Dan. 12:4, 9, 13 \x*It was revealed to them that \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [Matt. 13:17; Heb. 11:39, 40] \x*they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Acts 2:2-4 \x*by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [Dan. 8:13; 12:5-7; Eph. 3:10]\x*things into which angels long to look.
\s1 Called to Be Holy
\p
\v 13 Therefore, \x + \xo 1:13 \xt See Luke 12:35 \x*preparing your minds for action,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Greek \fq girding up the loins of your mind\f* and \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 4:7; 5:8; 1 Thess. 5:6, 8; 2 Tim. 4:5\x*being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
\v 14 As obedient children, \x + \xo 1:14 \xt ch. 4:2, 3; Rom. 12:2; Titus 3:3 \x*do not be conformed to the passions \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Acts 17:30\x*of your former ignorance,
\v 15 but \x + \xo 1:15 \xt 1 John 3:3; [2 Cor. 7:1; 1 Thess. 4:7; Heb. 12:14] \x*as he who called you is holy, you also be holy \x + \xo 1:15 \xt James 3:13\x*in all your conduct,
\v 16 since it is written, \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Cited from Lev. 11:44\x*“You shall be holy, for I am holy.”
\v 17 And if you \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Jer. 3:19; Mal. 1:6; 2 Cor. 6:18; [Matt. 6:9] \x*call on him as Father who \x + \xo 1:17 \xt See Ps. 62:12 \x*judges \x + \xo 1:17 \xt See James 2:1 \x*impartially according to each one’s deeds, conduct yourselves \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 3:15; 2 Cor. 7:1; [Rom. 11:20]\x*with fear throughout the time of your exile,
\v 18 knowing that you \x + \xo 1:18 \xt [Ps. 49:8; 130:8; 1 Cor. 6:20; Titus 2:14; 2 Pet. 2:1] \x*were ransomed from \x + \xo 1:18 \xt See Eph. 4:17\x*the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
\v 19 but \x + \xo 1:19 \xt See Acts 20:28 \x*with the precious blood of Christ, like that of \x + \xo 1:19 \xt See John 1:29 \x*a lamb \x + \xo 1:19 \xt Heb. 9:14; [Ex. 12:5]\x*without blemish or spot.
\v 20 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but \x + \xo 1:20 \xt See Rom. 16:26 \x*was made manifest \x + \xo 1:20 \xt Heb. 1:2\x*in the last times for the sake of you
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21 \xt John 12:44 \x*who through him are believers in God, \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [Rom. 10:9]; See Acts 2:24 \x*who raised him from the dead and \x + \xo 1:21 \xt Acts 3:13; Heb. 2:9; [ch. 3:22]; See John 7:39\x*gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
\p
\v 22 Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for \x + \xo 1:22 \xt Rom. 12:9; See Heb. 13:1 \x*a sincere brotherly love, \x + \xo 1:22 \xt 1 Tim. 1:5\x*love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23 \xt ver. 3; [John 3:3; James 1:18] \x*since you have been born again, \x + \xo 1:23 \xt John 1:13 \x*not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Heb. 4:12\x*the living and abiding word of God;
\v 24 for
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:24 \xt James 1:10, 11; Cited from Isa. 40:6, 8\x*“All flesh is like grass
\q2 and all its glory like the flower of grass.
\q1 The grass withers,
\q2 and the flower falls,
\q1
\v 25 \x + \xo 1:25 \xt [Matt. 24:35] \x*but the word of the Lord remains forever.”
\b
\m And this word \x + \xo 1:25 \xt Isa. 40:9\x*is the good news that was preached to you.
\c 2
\s1 A Living Stone and a Holy People
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Eph. 4:22, 25, 31; Col. 3:8\x*So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
\v 2 \x + \xo 2:2 \xt See Matt. 18:3 \x*Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual \x + \xo 2:2 \xt 1 Cor. 3:2; Heb. 5:12, 13\x*milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation—
\v 3 if indeed you have \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Ps. 34:8; Heb. 6:5\x*tasted that the Lord is good.
\p
\v 4 As you come to him, a living stone \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ver. 6, 7\x*rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious,
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Eph. 2:20-22; [1 Cor. 3:9] \x*you yourselves like living stones are being built up as \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Heb. 3:4, 6 \x*a spiritual house, to be \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ver. 9 \x*a holy priesthood, \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Isa. 56:7; Mal. 1:11; Rom. 12:1; Heb. 13:15 \x*to offer spiritual sacrifices \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Rom. 15:16; Phil. 4:18\x*acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
\v 6 For it stands in Scripture:
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Cited from Isa. 28:16 \x*“Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone,
\q2 a cornerstone chosen and precious,
\q1 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Rom. 9:33; 10:11\x*and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.”
\b
\m
\v 7 So the honor is for you who \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [2 Cor. 2:16] \x*believe, but for those who \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [2 Cor. 2:16] \x*do not believe,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Cited from Ps. 118:22\x*“The stone that the builders rejected
\q2 has become the cornerstone,”\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Greek \fq the head of the corner\f*
\b
\m
\v 8 and
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Rom. 9:33; Cited from Isa. 8:14 \x*“A stone of stumbling,
\q2 and a rock of offense.”
\b
\m They stumble because they disobey the word, \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [Rom. 9:22; Jude 4]\x*as they were destined to do.
\p
\v 9 But you are \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Deut. 10:15; Isa. 43:20 \x*a chosen race, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Ex. 19:6; Rev. 1:6; 5:10 \x*a royal \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Isa. 61:6; 66:21 \x*priesthood, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Deut. 7:6 \x*a holy nation, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Ex. 19:5; Deut. 7:6; Isa. 43:21; Mal. 3:17 \x*a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [Isa. 42:16]; See Acts 26:18 \x*out of darkness into \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Ps. 36:9\x*his marvelous light.
\v 10 \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Hos. 1:6, 9, 10; 2:23; Rom. 9:25, 26; 10:19\x*Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
\p
\v 11 Beloved, I urge you \x + \xo 2:11 \xt See Lev. 25:23 \x*as sojourners and exiles \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Rom. 13:14; Gal. 5:24 \x*to abstain from the passions of the flesh, \x + \xo 2:11 \xt James 4:1\x*which wage war against your soul.
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [ch. 3:16; 2 Cor. 8:21; Phil. 2:15; Titus 2:8] \x*Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Matt. 5:16; 2 Cor. 9:13; Gal. 1:24 \x*they may see your good deeds and glorify God on \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Isa. 10:3; Luke 19:44\x*the day of visitation.
\s1 Submission to Authority
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Rom. 13:1; Titus 3:1\x*Be subject for the Lord’s sake to every human institution,\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Or \fq every institution ordained for people\f* whether it be to the emperor\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Or \fq king\ft ; also verse 17\f* as supreme,
\v 14 or to governors as sent by him \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Rom. 13:4 \x*to punish those who do evil and \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Rom. 13:3\x*to praise those who do good.
\v 15 For this is the will of God, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ver. 12\x*that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16 \xt See James 1:25 \x*Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but \x + \xo 2:16 \xt 1 Cor. 7:22; [Rom. 6:22]\x*living as servants\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Greek \fq bondservants\f* of God.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Rom. 12:10; 13:7 \x*Honor everyone. \x + \xo 2:17 \xt See Heb. 13:1 \x*Love the brotherhood. \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Prov. 24:21\x*Fear God. Honor the emperor.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Eph. 6:5; Col. 3:22; 1 Tim. 6:1; Titus 2:9\x*Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.
\v 19 For this is a gracious thing, when, \x + \xo 2:19 \xt ch. 3:14, 17; [ch. 4:16]\x*mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
\v 20 For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But \x + \xo 2:20 \xt ch. 3:17, 18; 4:13, 16\x*if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
\v 21 For \x + \xo 2:21 \xt ch. 3:9; See Acts 14:22 \x*to this you have been called, \x + \xo 2:21 \xt [See ver. 20 above] \x*because Christ also suffered for you, \x + \xo 2:21 \xt See Matt. 11:29\x*leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
\v 22 \x + \xo 2:22 \xt Isa. 53:9; [2 Cor. 5:21; Heb. 4:15; 1 John 3:5]\x*He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23 \xt ch. 3:9; Isa. 53:7; Heb. 12:3 \x*When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, \x + \xo 2:23 \xt Luke 23:46\x*but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Isa. 53:4, 11; Matt. 8:17; Heb. 9:28 \x*He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Rom. 6:2, 11; 7:4, 6; Col. 2:20; 3:3 \x*might die to sin and \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Rom. 6:13 \x*live to righteousness. \x + \xo 2:24 \xt Isa. 53:5\x*By his wounds you have been healed.
\v 25 For \x + \xo 2:25 \xt Isa. 53:6; [Ps. 119:176; Ezek. 34:6; Luke 15:4] \x*you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to \x + \xo 2:25 \xt See John 10:11\x*the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
\c 3
\s1 Wives and Husbands
\p \v 1 Likewise, wives, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See Gen. 3:16 \x*be subject to your own husbands, so that \x + \xo 3:1 \xt 1 Cor. 7:16 \x*even if some do not obey the word, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Matt. 18:15; 1 Cor. 9:19-22\x*they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives,
\v 2 when they see your \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Titus 2:5\x*respectful and pure conduct.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt 1 Tim. 2:9; [Isa. 3:18-23]\x*Do not let your adorning be external—the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear—
\v 4 but let your adorning be \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Rom. 2:29; [Rom. 7:22; 2 Cor. 4:16; Eph. 3:16]\x*the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God’s sight is very precious.
\v 5 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,
\v 6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Gen. 18:12 \x*calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Prov. 3:25\x*do not fear anything that is frightening.
\p
\v 7 Likewise, \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Eph. 5:25; Col. 3:19 \x*husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See 1 Thess. 4:4\x*vessel, since they are heirs with you\f + \fr 3:7 \ft Some manuscripts \fq since you are joint heirs\f* of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
\s1 Suffering for Righteousness’ Sake
\p
\v 8 Finally, all of you, \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Rom. 12:16 \x*have unity of mind, sympathy, \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Heb. 13:1 \x*brotherly love, \x + \xo 3:8 \xt Eph. 4:32 \x*a tender heart, and \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Eph. 4:2\x*a humble mind.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt ch. 2:23; See Rom. 12:17 \x*Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Luke 6:28; Rom. 12:14; 1 Cor. 4:12 \x*bless, for \x + \xo 3:9 \xt ch. 2:21\x*to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.
\v 10 For
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 3:10 \xt Cited from Ps. 34:12-16\x*“Whoever desires to love life
\q2 and see good days,
\q1 let him keep his tongue from evil
\q2 and his lips from speaking deceit;
\q1
\v 11 let him turn away from evil and do good;
\q2 let him seek peace and pursue it.
\q1
\v 12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,
\q2 and his ears are open to their prayer.
\q1 But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.”
\b
\p
\v 13 Now \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [Prov. 16:7]\x*who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14 \xt ch. 2:19, 20; 4:14, 16; Matt. 5:10 \x*But even if you should suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed. \x + \xo 3:14 \xt Isa. 8:12, 13; [ver. 6; Matt. 10:28] \x*Have no fear of them, \x + \xo 3:14 \xt John 14:1, 27\x*nor be troubled,
\v 15 but \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [Isa. 29:23; Matt. 6:9] \x*in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, \x + \xo 3:15 \xt Col. 4:6; [2 Tim. 2:25] \x*always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See ch. 1:17\x*respect,
\v 16 \x + \xo 3:16 \xt Heb. 13:18 \x*having a good conscience, so that, \x + \xo 3:16 \xt ch. 2:12\x*when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
\v 17 For \x + \xo 3:17 \xt ch. 2:20; [ch. 4:15, 16]\x*it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God’s will, than for doing evil.
\p
\v 18 For Christ also \x + \xo 3:18 \xt ch. 2:21; 4:1; See Rom. 4:25 \x*suffered\f + \fr 3:18 \ft Some manuscripts \fq died\f* \x + \xo 3:18 \xt Heb. 9:26, 28 \x*once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, \x + \xo 3:18 \xt Rom. 5:2 \x*that he might bring us to God, being put to death \x + \xo 3:18 \xt ch. 4:1; Col. 1:22; [2 Cor. 13:4] \x*in the flesh but made alive \x + \xo 3:18 \xt ch. 4:6\x*in the spirit,
\v 19 in which\f + \fr 3:19 \ft Or \fq the Spirit, in whom\f* he went and \x + \xo 3:19 \xt [See ver. 18 above]\x*proclaimed\f + \fr 3:19 \ft Or \fq preached\f* to the spirits in prison,
\v 20 because\f + \fr 3:20 \ft Or \fq when\f* they formerly did not obey, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Gen. 6:3, 5, 13, 14 \x*when God’s patience waited in the days of Noah, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Heb. 11:7 \x*while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Gen. 7:1, 7, 23; 8:18; 2 Pet. 2:5\x*eight persons, were brought safely through water.
\v 21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, \x + \xo 3:21 \xt Mark 16:16; Acts 16:33; Rom. 6:3-6; Titus 3:5 \x*now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but \x + \xo 3:21 \xt [Rom. 10:10] \x*as an appeal to God for a good conscience, \x + \xo 3:21 \xt ch. 1:3\x*through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
\v 22 who has gone into heaven and \x + \xo 3:22 \xt Acts 2:33, 34; Rom. 8:34; Eph. 1:20; Col. 3:1; Heb. 1:3 \x*is at the right hand of God, \x + \xo 3:22 \xt Rom. 8:38; 1 Cor. 15:24; Eph. 1:21\x*with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
\c 4
\s1 Stewards of God’s Grace
\p \v 1 Since therefore \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 3:18 \x*Christ suffered in the flesh,\f + \fr 4:1 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq for us\ft ; some \fq for you\f* \x + \xo 4:1 \xt [Eph. 6:13] \x*arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for \x + \xo 4:1 \xt Rom. 6:2, 7; Gal. 5:24; Col. 3:3, 5 \x*whoever has suffered in the flesh \x + \xo 4:1 \xt [2 Pet. 2:14]\x*has ceased from sin,
\v 2 \x + \xo 4:2 \xt Rom. 6:14; 14:7; 2 Cor. 5:15 \x*so as to live for \x + \xo 4:2 \xt ch. 1:14 \x*the rest of the time in the flesh \x + \xo 4:2 \xt Titus 2:12; 1 John 2:16 \x*no longer for human passions but \x + \xo 4:2 \xt Rom. 6:11\x*for the will of God.
\v 3 For the time that is past \x + \xo 4:3 \xt Ezek. 44:6; 45:9; Acts 17:30 \x*suffices \x + \xo 4:3 \xt Eph. 4:17-19; 1 Thess. 4:5; [1 Cor. 12:2]\x*for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.
\v 4 With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of \x + \xo 4:4 \xt See Eph. 5:18 \x*debauchery, and \x + \xo 4:4 \xt ch. 2:12; 3:16\x*they malign you;
\v 5 but they will give account to him who is ready \x + \xo 4:5 \xt [James 5:9]; See Acts 10:42\x*to judge the living and the dead.
\v 6 For this is why \x + \xo 4:6 \xt ch. 3:19\x*the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7 \xt See James 5:8 \x*The end of all things is at hand; therefore \x + \xo 4:7 \xt See ch. 1:13 \x*be self-controlled and sober-minded \x + \xo 4:7 \xt Matt. 26:41; Luke 21:36\x*for the sake of your prayers.
\v 8 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since \x + \xo 4:8 \xt [1 Cor. 13:5, 6]; See James 5:20\x*love covers a multitude of sins.
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9 \xt Heb. 13:2; [1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:8]\x*Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10 \xt Rom. 12:6, 7; 1 Cor. 4:7; [Matt. 25:15] \x*As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, \x + \xo 4:10 \xt Luke 12:42; 1 Cor. 4:1, 2; Titus 1:7\x*as good stewards of God’s varied grace:
\v 11 whoever speaks, as one who speaks \x + \xo 4:11 \xt Acts 7:38; Rom. 3:2; Heb. 5:12 \x*oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves \x + \xo 4:11 \xt Rom. 12:3 \x*by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything \x + \xo 4:11 \xt 1 Cor. 10:31 \x*God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. \x + \xo 4:11 \xt See Rom. 11:36 \x*To him belong glory and \x + \xo 4:11 \xt ch. 5:11; Jude 25; Rev. 1:6; 5:13\x*dominion forever and ever. Amen.
\s1 Suffering as a Christian
\p
\v 12 Beloved, do not be surprised at \x + \xo 4:12 \xt ch. 1:7\x*the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
\v 13 But rejoice \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Phil. 3:10, 11; See Acts 5:41 \x*insofar as you share Christ’s sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad \x + \xo 4:13 \xt [ch. 1:5-7; 5:1; Rom. 8:17, 18; Jude 24]\x*when his glory is revealed.
\v 14 \x + \xo 4:14 \xt Ps. 89:51; Matt. 5:11 \x*If you are insulted \x + \xo 4:14 \xt John 15:21; [Heb. 11:26]\x*for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory\f + \fr 4:14 \ft Some manuscripts insert \fq and of power\f* and of God rests upon you.
\v 15 But \x + \xo 4:15 \xt ch. 2:19, 20; 3:14, 17 \x*let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or \x + \xo 4:15 \xt 1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:11; 1 Tim. 5:13\x*as a meddler.
\v 16 Yet \x + \xo 4:16 \xt [See ver. 15 above] \x*if anyone suffers as a \x + \xo 4:16 \xt See Acts 26:28 \x*Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God \x + \xo 4:16 \xt [See ver. 14 above]\x*in that name.
\v 17 For it is time for judgment \x + \xo 4:17 \xt Jer. 25:29; Ezek. 9:6; Amos 3:2; Rom. 2:9 \x*to begin at the household of God; and \x + \xo 4:17 \xt [Luke 23:31] \x*if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who \x + \xo 4:17 \xt [2 Thess. 1:8]\x*do not obey the gospel of God?
\v 18 And
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 4:18 \xt Prov. 11:31\x*“If the righteous is scarcely saved,
\q2 what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?”\f + \fr 4:18 \ft Greek \fq where will the ungodly and sinner appear?\f*
\b
\m
\v 19 Therefore let those who suffer according to God’s will \x + \xo 4:19 \xt Ps. 31:5; Luke 23:46; [Ps. 10:14; 2 Tim. 1:12]\x*entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.

\s1 Shepherd the Flock of God
\p \v 1 So I exhort the elders among you, \x + \xo 5:1 \xt [2 John 1; 3 John 1] \x*as a fellow elder and \x + \xo 5:1 \xt See Luke 24:48\x*a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [Jude 12]; See John 21:16 \x*shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight,\f + \fr 5:2 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq exercising oversight\f* \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [Philem. 14] \x*not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you;\f + \fr 5:2 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq as God would have you\f* \x + \xo 5:2 \xt 1 Tim. 3:8; Titus 1:7\x*not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
\v 3 not \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Ezek. 34:4; Matt. 20:25; Mark 10:42; 2 Cor. 1:24 \x*domineering over those in your charge, but \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Phil. 3:17; 2 Thess. 3:9; 1 Tim. 4:12; Titus 2:7\x*being examples to the flock.
\v 4 And when \x + \xo 5:4 \xt Heb. 13:20 \x*the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the \x + \xo 5:4 \xt [ch. 1:4] \x*unfading \x + \xo 5:4 \xt 1 Cor. 9:25; See James 1:12\x*crown of glory.
\v 5 Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [Matt. 20:26, 27; John 13:4, 5, 14] \x*Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for \x + \xo 5:5 \xt See James 4:6, 10\x*“God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.”
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 5:6 \xt [See ver. 5 above]\x*Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
\v 7 \x + \xo 5:7 \xt [Ps. 37:5; 55:22]; See Matt. 6:25 \x*casting all your anxieties on him, because \x + \xo 5:7 \xt Ps. 40:17\x*he cares for you.
\v 8 \x + \xo 5:8 \xt See ch. 1:13 \x*Be sober-minded; \x + \xo 5:8 \xt See Matt. 24:42 \x*be watchful. Your \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Eph. 4:27; 6:11; Rev. 12:9, 12; [Job 1:9-12; Luke 22:31; 2 Cor. 2:11] \x*adversary the devil \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Job 1:7; 2:2 \x*prowls around \x + \xo 5:8 \xt [Ps. 22:21]\x*like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
\v 9 \x + \xo 5:9 \xt James 4:7 \x*Resist him, \x + \xo 5:9 \xt Col. 2:5 \x*firm in your faith, knowing that \x + \xo 5:9 \xt Acts 14:22; 1 Thess. 3:3; 2 Tim. 3:12\x*the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
\v 10 And \x + \xo 5:10 \xt ch. 1:6 \x*after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, \x + \xo 5:10 \xt 1 Cor. 1:9; 1 Thess. 2:12; 1 Tim. 6:12 \x*who has called you to his \x + \xo 5:10 \xt 2 Tim. 2:10 \x*eternal glory in Christ, will himself \x + \xo 5:10 \xt Heb. 13:21 \x*restore, \x + \xo 5:10 \xt Luke 22:32; Rom. 16:25\x*confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
\v 11 \x + \xo 5:11 \xt See ch. 4:11\x*To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
