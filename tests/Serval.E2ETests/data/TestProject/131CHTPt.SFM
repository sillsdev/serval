\v 4 Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and mistreat me.” But his armor-bearer would not, for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword and fell upon it.
\v 5 And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword and died.

\v 7 And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army\f + \fr 10:7 \ft Hebrew \fq they\f* had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.

\v 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the \nd Lord\nd*. And they anointed David king over Israel, \x + \xo 11:3 \xt ver. 10; ch. 12:23; 1 Sam. 16:1, 3, 12, 13\x*according to the word of the \nd Lord\nd* by Samuel.
\s1 David Takes Jerusalem

\v 4 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, \x + \xo 11:4 \xt See Josh. 15:8 \x*that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were, \x + \xo 11:4 \xt Judg. 1:21\x*the inhabitants of the land.
\v 5 The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, “You will not come in here.” Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
\v 6 David said, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites first \x + \xo 11:6 \xt 2 Sam. 8:16\x*shall be chief and commander.” And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief.
\v 7 And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David.
\v 8 And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city.
\v 9 And David \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Esth. 9:4\x*became greater and greater, for the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts was with him.
\s1 David’s Mighty Men
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 11:10 \xt For ver. 10-41, see 2 Sam. 23:8-39 \x*Now these are the chiefs of David’s mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, \x + \xo 11:10 \xt ver. 3\x*according to the word of the \nd Lord\nd* concerning Israel.
\v 11 This is an account of David’s mighty men: \x + \xo 11:11 \xt [2 Sam. 23:8] \x*Jashobeam, a \x + \xo 11:11 \xt [2 Sam. 23:8] \x*Hachmonite, was \x + \xo 11:11 \xt [ch. 12:18]\x*chief of the three.\f + \fr 11:11 \ft Compare 2 Samuel 23:8; Hebrew \fq thirty\ft , or \fq captains\f* He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.
\p
\v 12 And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of \x + \xo 11:12 \xt [ch. 27:4]\x*Dodo, the Ahohite.
\v 13 He was with David at Pas-dammim \x + \xo 11:13 \xt [2 Sam. 23:11, 12]\x*when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines.
\v 14 But he took his\f + \fr 11:14 \ft Compare 2 Samuel 23:12; Hebrew \fq they~.~.~. their\f* stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the \nd Lord\nd* saved them by a great victory.
\p
\v 15 Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the \x + \xo 11:15 \xt ch. 14:8\x*Valley of Rephaim.
\v 16 David was then in the stronghold, and the \x + \xo 11:16 \xt [1 Sam. 10:5]\x*garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.
\v 17 And David said longingly, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!”
\v 18 Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the \nd Lord\nd*
\v 19 and said, “Far be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.” Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.
\p
\v 20 Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty.\f + \fr 11:20 \ft Syriac; Hebrew \fq three\f* And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three.
\v 21 He was the most renowned\f + \fr 11:21 \ft Compare 2 Samuel 23:19; Hebrew \fq more renowned among the two\f* of the thirty\f + \fr 11:21 \ft Syriac; Hebrew \fq three\f* and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.
\p
\v 22 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man\f + \fr 11:22 \ft Syriac; Hebrew \fq the son of a valiant man\f* of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.
\v 23 And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits\f + \fr 11:23 \ft A \fq cubit \ft was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters\f* tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear \x + \xo 11:23 \xt 1 Sam. 17:7\x*like a weaver’s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear.
\v 24 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and won a name beside the three mighty men.
\v 25 He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.
\p
\v 26 The mighty men were \x + \xo 11:26 \xt ch. 27:7\x*Asahel the brother of Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

\p \v 1 \x + \xo 12:1 \xt See 1 Sam. 27:2-6\x*Now these are the men who came to David at Ziklag, while he could not move about freely because of Saul the son of Kish. And they were among the mighty men who helped him in war.
\v 2 They \x + \xo 12:2 \xt 2 Chr. 17:17; Ps. 78:9 \x*were bowmen and could shoot arrows and sling stones with either the right or the \x + \xo 12:2 \xt [Judg. 3:15; 20:16] \x*left hand; they were Benjaminites, \x + \xo 12:2 \xt ver. 29\x*Saul’s kinsmen.
\v 3 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, both sons of Shemaah of \x + \xo 12:3 \xt Josh. 18:28 \x*Gibeah; also Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; Beracah, Jehu of \x + \xo 12:3 \xt ch. 11:28; 27:12\x*Anathoth,

\v 7 And Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
\p
\v 8 From the Gadites there went over to David at the stronghold in the wilderness mighty and experienced warriors, expert with shield and spear, whose faces were like the faces of lions and who were \x + \xo 12:8 \xt 2 Sam. 2:18\x*swift as gazelles upon the mountains:

\v 10 Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,
\v 11 Attai sixth, Eliel seventh,
\v 12 Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,
\v 13 Jeremiah tenth, Machbannai eleventh.
\v 14 These Gadites were officers of the army; the least was a \x + \xo 12:14 \xt [Lev. 26:8]\x*match for a hundred men and the greatest for a thousand.
\v 15 These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month, when it was \x + \xo 12:15 \xt See Josh. 3:15\x*overflowing all its banks, and put to flight all those in the valleys, to the east and to the west.
\p
\v 16 And some of the men of Benjamin and Judah came to the stronghold to David.
\v 17 David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come to me in friendship to help me, my heart will be joined to you; but if to betray me to my adversaries, although there is no wrong in my hands, then may the God of our fathers see and rebuke you.”
\v 18 Then \x + \xo 12:18 \xt See Judg. 3:10 \x*the Spirit clothed \x + \xo 12:18 \xt [2 Sam. 17:25] \x*Amasai, chief of the thirty, and he said,

\b
\m Then David received them and made them officers of his troops.
\p
\v 19 Some of the men of Manasseh deserted to David \x + \xo 12:19 \xt See 1 Sam. 29:2-9 \x*when he came with the Philistines for the battle against Saul. (Yet he did not help them, for the rulers of the Philistines took counsel and sent him away, saying, \x + \xo 12:19 \xt [1 Sam. 29:4]\x*“At peril to our heads he will desert to his master Saul.”)
\v 20 As he went to Ziklag, these men of Manasseh deserted to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh.
\v 21 They helped David against \x + \xo 12:21 \xt 1 Sam. 30:1\x*the band of raiders, for they were all mighty men of valor and were commanders in the army.
\v 22 For from day to day men came to David to help him, until there was a great army, like an army of God.
\p
\v 23 These are the numbers of the divisions of the armed troops \x + \xo 12:23 \xt ch. 11:1; 2 Sam. 2:3, 4; 5:1 \x*who came to David in Hebron \x + \xo 12:23 \xt ch. 10:14 \x*to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, \x + \xo 12:23 \xt ch. 11:3, 10; 1 Sam. 16:1, 3\x*according to the word of the \nd Lord\nd*.

\p
\v 38 All these, men of war, arrayed in battle order, came to Hebron with \x + \xo 12:38 \xt [1 Kgs. 8:61] \x*a whole heart to make David king over all Israel. Likewise, all the rest of Israel were of a \x + \xo 12:38 \xt [ver. 33]\x*single mind to make David king.
\v 39 And they were there with David for three days, eating and drinking, for their brothers had made preparation for them.
\v 40 And also their relatives, from as far as Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, came bringing food on donkeys and on camels and on mules and on oxen, abundant provisions of flour, \x + \xo 12:40 \xt [1 Sam. 25:18; 30:12]\x*cakes of figs, clusters of raisins, and wine and oil, oxen and sheep, for there was joy in Israel.

\s1 The Ark Brought from Kiriath-Jearim
\p \v 1 David consulted with the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, with every leader.
\v 2 And David said to all the assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you and from the \nd Lord\nd* our God, let us send abroad to our brothers \x + \xo 13:2 \xt [1 Sam. 31:1]\x*who remain in all the lands of Israel, as well as to the priests and Levites in the cities that have pasturelands, that they may be gathered to us.

\v 7 And they carried the ark of God on a new cart, from the house of \x + \xo 13:7 \xt [1 Sam. 7:1]\x*Abinadab, and Uzzah and Ahio\f + \fr 13:7 \ft Or \fq and his brother\f* were driving the cart.

\p
\v 9 And when they came to the threshing floor of \x + \xo 13:9 \xt [2 Sam. 6:6]\x*Chidon, Uzzah put out his hand to take hold of the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
\v 10 And the anger of the \nd Lord\nd* was kindled against Uzzah, and he struck him down \x + \xo 13:10 \xt [ch. 15:13, 15; Num. 4:15] \x*because he put out his hand to the ark, and \x + \xo 13:10 \xt Lev. 10:2\x*he died there before God.
\v 11 And David was angry because the \nd Lord\nd* had broken out against Uzzah. And that place is called Perez-uzza\f + \fr 13:11 \fq Perez-uzza \ft means \fq the breaking out against Uzzah\f* to this day.
\v 12 And David was afraid of God that day, and he said, “How can I bring the ark of God home to me?”
\v 13 So David did not take the ark home into the city of David, but took it aside to the house \x + \xo 13:13 \xt [2 Chr. 25:24]\x*of Obed-edom the Gittite.
\v 14 And the ark of God remained with the household of Obed-edom in his house three months. \x + \xo 13:14 \xt [ch. 26:4, 5]\x*And the \nd Lord\nd* blessed the household of Obed-edom and all that he had.

\s1 Philistines Defeated
\p
\v 8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to search for David. But David heard of it and went out against them.
\v 9 Now the Philistines had come and \x + \xo 14:9 \xt ver. 13 \x*made a raid in the \x + \xo 14:9 \xt ch. 11:15\x*Valley of Rephaim.
\v 10 And David inquired of God, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?” And the \nd Lord\nd* said to him, “Go up, and I will give them into your hand.”
\v 11 And he went up to Baal-perazim, and David struck them down there. And David said, “God has broken through\f + \fr 14:11 \fq Baal-perazim \ft means \fq Lord of breaking through\f* my enemies by my hand, like a bursting flood.” Therefore the name of that place is called Baal-perazim.
\v 12 And they left their gods there, and David gave command, and they were burned.
\p
\v 13 And the Philistines yet again \x + \xo 14:13 \xt ver. 9\x*made a raid in the valley.
\v 14 And when David again inquired of God, \x + \xo 14:14 \xt ver. 16\x*God said to him, “You shall not go up after them; go around and come against them opposite the balsam trees.
\v 15 And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to strike down the army of the Philistines.”
\v 16 And David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer.
\v 17 And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the \nd Lord\nd* brought the \x + \xo 14:17 \xt [Deut. 2:25]\x*fear of him upon all nations.

\v 2 Then David said that no one but the Levites may carry \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ver. 15, 26; Num. 4:2, 15\x*the ark of God, for the \nd Lord\nd* had chosen them to carry the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* and to minister to him forever.
\v 3 \x + \xo 15:3 \xt ch. 13:5; [1 Kgs. 8:1] \x*And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 15:3 \xt ver. 1, 12; 2 Sam. 6:17\x*to its place, which he had prepared for it.

\v 22 Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in music, should direct the music, for he understood it.

\v 27 David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as also were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers and Chenaniah the leader of the music of the singers. And David wore a linen ephod.

\p \v 1 \x + \xo 17:1 \xt For ver. 1-27, see 2 Sam. 7:1-29\x*Now when David lived in his house, David said to Nathan the prophet, “Behold, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the \nd Lord\nd* is under a tent.”
\v 2 And Nathan said to David, “Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.”
\p
\v 3 But that same night the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Nathan,
\v 4 “Go and tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 17:4 \xt ch. 28:3\x*It is not you who will build me a house to dwell in.
\v 5 For I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up Israel to this day, \x + \xo 17:5 \xt [2 Sam. 7:6]\x*but I have gone from tent to tent and from dwelling to dwelling.
\v 6 In all places where I have moved with all Israel, did I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, saying, “Why have you not built me a house of cedar?”’
\v 7 Now, therefore, thus shall you say to my servant David, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be prince over my people Israel,
\v 8 and I have been with you wherever you have gone and have cut off all your enemies from before you. And I will make for you a name, like the name of the great ones of the earth.
\v 9 And I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be disturbed no more. And violent men shall waste them no more, as formerly,
\v 10 from the time that I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I \x + \xo 17:10 \xt [2 Sam. 7:11]\x*will subdue all your enemies. Moreover, I declare to you that the \nd Lord\nd* will build you a house.
\v 11 When your days are fulfilled to walk with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.
\v 12 He shall build a house for me, and I will establish his throne forever.
\v 13 \x + \xo 17:13 \xt Cited Heb. 1:5 \x*I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. I will not take my steadfast love from him, \x + \xo 17:13 \xt [1 Sam. 15:23, 28]\x*as I took it from him who was before you,
\v 14 but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom forever, and his throne shall be established forever.’”
\v 15 In accordance with all these words, and in accordance with all this vision, Nathan spoke to David.

\p
\v 16 Then King David went in and sat before the \nd Lord\nd* and said, “Who am I, O \nd Lord\nd* God, and what is my house, that you have brought me thus far?

\v 23 And now, O \nd Lord\nd*, let the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house be established forever, and do as you have spoken,
\v 24 and your name will be established and magnified forever, saying, ‘The \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel’s God,’ and the house of your servant David will be established before you.
\v 25 For you, my God, have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him. Therefore your servant has found courage to pray before you.
\v 26 And now, O \nd Lord\nd*, you are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant.
\v 27 Now you have been pleased to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue forever before you, for it is you, O \nd Lord\nd*, who have blessed, and it is blessed forever.”

\v 2 And David said, “I will deal kindly with Hanun the son of Nahash, for his father dealt kindly with me.” So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. And David’s servants came to the land of the Ammonites to Hanun to console him.
\v 3 But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, “Do you think, because David has sent comforters to you, that he is honoring your father? Have not his servants come to you to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?”
\v 4 So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved them and cut off their garments in the middle, at their hips, and sent them away;
\v 5 and they departed. When David was told concerning the men, he sent messengers to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, “Remain at Jericho until your beards have grown and then return.”

\s1 The Capture of Rabbah
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 20:1 \xt 2 Sam. 11:1 \x*In the spring of the year, the time when kings go out to battle, Joab led out the army and ravaged the country of the Ammonites and came and besieged Rabbah. But David remained at Jerusalem. And \x + \xo 20:1 \xt 2 Sam. 12:26\x*Joab struck down Rabbah and overthrew it.
\v 2 \x + \xo 20:2 \xt For ver. 2, 3, see 2 Sam. 12:30, 31\x*And David took the crown of their king from his head. He found that it weighed a talent\f + \fr 20:2 \ft A \fq talent \ft was about 75 pounds or 34 kilograms\f* of gold, and in it was a precious stone. And it was placed on David’s head. And he brought out the spoil of the city, a very great amount.

\s1 Philistine Giants Killed

\v 4 \x + \xo 20:4 \xt For ver. 4-8, see 2 Sam. 21:18-22\x*And after this there arose war with the Philistines at Gezer. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck down Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the giants, and the Philistines were subdued.
\v 5 And there was again war with the Philistines, and Elhanan the son of \x + \xo 20:5 \xt [2 Sam. 21:19]\x*Jair struck down Lahmi \x + \xo 20:5 \xt [2 Sam. 21:19]\x*the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
\v 6 And there was again war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number, and he also was descended from the giants.
\v 7 And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of \x + \xo 20:7 \xt ch. 2:13; 2 Sam. 13:3; [1 Sam. 16:9; 17:13]\x*Shimea, David’s brother, struck him down.

\s1 David’s Census Brings Pestilence
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 21:1 \xt For ver. 1-28, see 2 Sam. 24:1-25 \x*Then \x + \xo 21:1 \xt Zech. 3:1, 2; [2 Sam. 24:1]; See Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7\x*Satan stood against Israel and incited David to number Israel.
\v 2 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, “Go, number Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me a report, that I may know their number.”
\v 3 But Joab said, “May the \nd Lord\nd* add to his people a hundred times as many as they are! Are they not, my lord the king, all of them my lord’s servants? Why then should my lord require this? Why should it be a cause of guilt for Israel?”
\v 4 But the king’s word prevailed against Joab. So Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came back to Jerusalem.
\v 5 And Joab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to David. In all Israel there were \x + \xo 21:5 \xt [2 Sam. 24:9]\x*1,100,000 men who drew the sword, and in Judah \x + \xo 21:5 \xt [2 Sam. 24:9]\x*470,000 who drew the sword.
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6 \xt ch. 27:24\x*But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the numbering, for the king’s command was abhorrent to Joab.
\p
\v 7 But God was displeased with this thing, and he struck Israel.
\v 8 And David said to God, “I have sinned greatly in that I have done this thing. But now, please \x + \xo 21:8 \xt [2 Sam. 12:13]\x*take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”
\v 9 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Gad, David’s \x + \xo 21:9 \xt ch. 29:29; See 1 Sam. 9:9\x*seer, saying,
\v 10 “Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you.’”
\v 11 So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, ‘Choose what you will:
\v 12 either \x + \xo 21:12 \xt [2 Sam. 24:13]\x*three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or else three days of the sword of the \nd Lord\nd*, pestilence on the land, with the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me.”
\v 13 Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let me fall into the hand of the \nd Lord\nd*, for his mercy is very great, but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”
\p
\v 14 So the \nd Lord\nd* sent a pestilence on Israel, and 70,000 men of Israel fell.
\v 15 And God sent the angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but as he was about to destroy it, the \nd Lord\nd* saw, and he \x + \xo 21:15 \xt See Gen. 6:6\x*relented from the calamity. And he said to the angel who was working destruction, “It is enough; now stay your hand.” And the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* was standing by the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 16 And David lifted his eyes and saw the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* standing between earth and heaven, and in his hand a drawn sword stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, \x + \xo 21:16 \xt 1 Kgs. 20:31; See 2 Sam. 3:31\x*clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.
\v 17 And David said to God, “Was it not I who gave command to number the people? It is I who have sinned and done great evil. But these sheep, what have they done? Please let your hand, O \nd Lord\nd* my God, be against me and against my father’s house. But do not let the plague be on your people.”
\s1 David Builds an Altar
\p
\v 18 Now \x + \xo 21:18 \xt [2 Chr. 3:1]\x*the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* had commanded Gad to say to David that David should go up and raise an altar to the \nd Lord\nd* on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 19 So David went up at Gad’s word, which he had spoken in the name of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 20 Now Ornan was threshing wheat. He turned and saw the angel, and his four sons who were with him hid themselves.
\v 21 As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out from the threshing floor and paid homage to David with his face to the ground.
\v 22 And David said to Ornan, “Give me the site of the threshing floor that I may build on it an altar to the \nd Lord\nd*—give it to me at its full price—that the plague may be averted from the people.”
\v 23 Then Ornan said to David, “Take it, and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I give the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for a grain offering; I give it all.”
\v 24 But King David said to Ornan, “No, but I will buy them for the full price. I will not take for the \nd Lord\nd* what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing.”
\v 25 So David paid Ornan \x + \xo 21:25 \xt [2 Sam. 24:24]\x*600 shekels\f + \fr 21:25 \ft A \fq shekel \ft was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams\f* of gold by weight for the site.
\v 26 And David built there an altar to the \nd Lord\nd* and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings and called on the \nd Lord\nd*, and the \nd Lord\nd*\f + \fr 21:26 \ft Hebrew \fq he\f* \x + \xo 21:26 \xt See Lev. 9:24\x*answered him with fire from heaven upon the altar of burnt offering.
\v 27 Then the \nd Lord\nd* commanded the angel, and he put his sword back into its sheath.
\p
\v 28 At that time, when David saw that the \nd Lord\nd* had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he sacrificed there.
\v 29 For the tabernacle of the \nd Lord\nd*, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering \x + \xo 21:29 \xt ch. 16:39; 2 Chr. 1:3; [1 Kgs. 3:4]\x*were at that time in the high place at Gibeon,
\v 30 but David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\c 22
\p \v 1 Then David said, \x + \xo 22:1 \xt ch. 21:18, 19, 26, 28; 2 Chr. 3:1; [Deut. 12:5]\x*“Here shall be the house of the \nd Lord\nd* God and here the altar of burnt offering for Israel.”
\s1 David Prepares for Temple Building
\p
\v 2 David commanded to gather together the \x + \xo 22:2 \xt [1 Kgs. 9:20, 21; 2 Chr. 2:17] \x*resident aliens who were in the land of Israel, and he \x + \xo 22:2 \xt [1 Kgs. 5:17]\x*set stonecutters to prepare dressed stones for building the house of God.
\v 3 David also provided great quantities of iron for nails for the doors of the gates and for clamps, \x + \xo 22:3 \xt ver. 14; 1 Kgs. 7:47\x*as well as bronze in quantities beyond weighing,
\v 4 and cedar timbers without number, \x + \xo 22:4 \xt [1 Kgs. 5:6]\x*for the Sidonians and Tyrians brought great quantities of cedar to David.
\v 5 For David said, \x + \xo 22:5 \xt ch. 29:1; [1 Kgs. 3:7; Prov. 4:3]\x*“Solomon my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the \nd Lord\nd* must be exceedingly magnificent, of fame and glory throughout all lands. I will therefore make preparation for it.” So David provided materials in great quantity before his death.
\s1 Solomon Charged to Build the Temple
\p
\v 6 Then he called for Solomon his son and charged him to build a house for the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel.
\v 7 David said to Solomon, “My son, \x + \xo 22:7 \xt ch. 17:1, 2; 28:2; 2 Sam. 7:2, 3; 1 Kgs. 8:17; See Ps. 132:1-5\x*I had it in my heart to build a house to the name of the \nd Lord\nd* my God.
\v 8 But the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me, saying, \x + \xo 22:8 \xt ch. 28:3; [1 Kgs. 5:3]\x*‘You have shed much blood and have waged great wars. You shall not build a house to my name, because you have shed so much blood before me on the earth.
\v 9 Behold, a son shall be born to you who shall be a man of rest. \x + \xo 22:9 \xt 1 Kgs. 5:4; [ver. 18; 1 Kgs. 4:25] \x*I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies. \x + \xo 22:9 \xt 2 Sam. 12:24\x*For his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel in his days.

\p
\v 11 “Now, my son, \x + \xo 22:11 \xt ver. 16; [1 Sam. 20:13]\x*the \nd Lord\nd* be with you, so that you may succeed in building the house of the \nd Lord\nd* your God, as he has spoken concerning you.

\p
\v 17 David also commanded \x + \xo 22:17 \xt See ch. 28:1-6\x*all the leaders of Israel to help Solomon his son, saying,
\v 18 “Is not the \nd Lord\nd* your God with you? And \x + \xo 22:18 \xt ch. 23:25; [Deut. 12:10; Josh. 21:44; 23:1; 2 Sam. 7:1]; See ver. 9\x*has he not given you peace on every side?

\v 10 And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, and Jeush and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
\v 11 Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second; but Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, therefore they became counted as a single father’s house.

\v 16 the weight of gold for each table for the showbread, the silver for the silver tables,
\v 17 and pure gold for the forks, the basins and the cups; for the golden bowls and the weight of each; for the silver bowls and the weight of each;
\v 18 for the \x + \xo 28:18 \xt See Ex. 30:1 \x*altar of incense made of refined gold, and its weight; also his plan for the golden chariot of the \x + \xo 28:18 \xt See Ex. 25:18-22; 1 Kgs. 6:23-28\x*cherubim that spread their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 19 “All this he made clear to me in writing from the hand of the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 28:19 \xt ver. 11, 12; Ex. 25:40\x*all the work to be done according to the plan.”

\v 20 Then David said to Solomon his son, \x + \xo 28:20 \xt See ch. 22:13; Josh. 1:5\x*“Be strong and courageous and do it.

\v 21 And behold the \x + \xo 28:21 \xt ver. 13; See ch. 24-26 \x*divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be \x + \xo 28:21 \xt [Ex. 35:25, 26; 36:1, 2]\x*every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command.”

\s1 Offerings for the Temple
\p \v 1 And David the king said to all the assembly, “Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is \x + \xo 29:1 \xt ch. 22:5; [1 Kgs. 3:7] \x*young and inexperienced, and the work is great, for \x + \xo 29:1 \xt ver. 19\x*the palace will not be for man but for the \nd Lord\nd* God.
\v 2 So I have provided for the house of my God, so far as I was able, the gold for the things of gold, the silver for the things of silver, and the bronze for the things of bronze, the iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood, besides great quantities of \x + \xo 29:2 \xt [Isa. 54:11, 12; Rev. 21:19-21]\x*onyx and stones for setting, antimony, colored stones, all sorts of precious stones and marble.
\v 3 Moreover, in addition to all that I have provided for the holy house, I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, and because of my devotion to the house of my God I give it to the house of my God:
\v 4 \x + \xo 29:4 \xt [ch. 22:14] \x*3,000 talents\f + \fr 29:4 \ft A \fq talent \ft was about 75 pounds or 34 kilograms\f* of gold, of the gold of \x + \xo 29:4 \xt See 1 Kgs. 9:28\x*Ophir, and 7,000 talents of refined silver, for overlaying the walls of the house,\f + \fr 29:4 \ft Septuagint; Hebrew \fq houses\f*
\v 5 and for all the work to be done by craftsmen, gold for the things of gold and silver for the things of silver. Who then will offer willingly, consecrating himself\f + \fr 29:5 \ft Or \fq ordaining himself\ft ; Hebrew \fq filling his hand\f* today to the \nd Lord\nd*?”
\p
\v 6 Then \x + \xo 29:6 \xt ch. 27:1; 28:1 \x*the leaders of fathers’ houses made their freewill offerings, as did also the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and \x + \xo 29:6 \xt See ch. 27:25-31\x*the officers over the king’s work.
\v 7 They gave for the service of the house of God 5,000 talents and 10,000 \x + \xo 29:7 \xt Ezra 2:69; 8:27; Neh. 7:70-72\x*darics\f + \fr 29:7 \ft A \fq daric \ft was a coin weighing about 1/4 ounce or 8.5 grams\f* of gold, 10,000 talents of silver, 18,000 talents of bronze and 100,000 talents of iron.
\v 8 And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, in the care of \x + \xo 29:8 \xt ch. 23:8; [ch. 26:21]\x*Jehiel the Gershonite.
\v 9 Then the people rejoiced because they had given willingly, for with a \x + \xo 29:9 \xt [2 Kgs. 12:4; 2 Cor. 9:7]\x*whole heart they had offered freely to the \nd Lord\nd*. David the king also rejoiced greatly.
\s1 David Prays in the Assembly
\p
\v 10 Therefore David blessed the \nd Lord\nd* in the presence of all the assembly. And David said: \x + \xo 29:10 \xt Luke 1:68\x*“Blessed are you, O \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.
\v 11 \x + \xo 29:11 \xt [1 Tim. 1:17; Rev. 5:13]\x*Yours, O \nd Lord\nd*, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O \nd Lord\nd*, and you are exalted as head above all.
\v 12 \x + \xo 29:12 \xt [1 Kgs. 3:13; 2 Chr. 1:12; Rom. 11:36] \x*Both riches and honor come from you, and you rule over all. \x + \xo 29:12 \xt 2 Chr. 20:6\x*In your hand are power and might, and in your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.
\v 13 And now we thank you, our God, and praise your glorious name.
\p
\v 14 “But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able thus to offer willingly? For all things come from you, and of your own have we given you.
\v 15 \x + \xo 29:15 \xt See Lev. 25:23 \x*For we are strangers before you and sojourners, as all our fathers were. Our days on the earth are \x + \xo 29:15 \xt Job 14:2; Ps. 102:11; 144:4\x*like a shadow, and there is no abiding.\f + \fr 29:15 \ft Septuagint, Vulgate; Hebrew \fq hope\ft , or \fq prospect\f*
\v 16 O \nd Lord\nd* our God, all this abundance that we have provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand and is all your own.
\v 17 I know, my God, \x + \xo 29:17 \xt ch. 28:9; Prov. 17:3; [1 Sam. 16:7] \x*that you test the heart and \x + \xo 29:17 \xt [Prov. 11:20]\x*have pleasure in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things, and now I have seen your people, who are present here, offering freely and joyously to you.
\v 18 O \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the hearts of your people, and direct their hearts toward you.
\v 19 \x + \xo 29:19 \xt [Ps. 72:1] \x*Grant to Solomon my son a whole heart that he may keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, performing all, and that he may \x + \xo 29:19 \xt ver. 1, 2 \x*build the palace \x + \xo 29:19 \xt ch. 22:14\x*for which I have made provision.”
\p
\v 20 Then David said to all the assembly, \x + \xo 29:20 \xt See Josh. 22:33 \x*“Bless the \nd Lord\nd* your God.” And all the assembly blessed the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of their fathers, \x + \xo 29:20 \xt See Ex. 4:31\x*and bowed their heads and paid homage to the \nd Lord\nd* and to the king.
\v 21 And they offered sacrifices to the \nd Lord\nd*, and on the next day offered burnt offerings to the \nd Lord\nd*, 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their \x + \xo 29:21 \xt Gen. 35:14\x*drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.
\v 22 And they ate and drank before the \nd Lord\nd* on that day with great gladness.
\s1 Solomon Anointed King
\p And they made Solomon the son of David king \x + \xo 29:22 \xt [ch. 23:1] \x*the second time, and they \x + \xo 29:22 \xt See 1 Kgs. 1:38, 39 \x*anointed him as prince for the \nd Lord\nd*, and \x + \xo 29:22 \xt 1 Kgs. 2:35\x*Zadok as priest.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 29:23 \xt 1 Kgs. 2:12 \x*Then Solomon sat on the \x + \xo 29:23 \xt ch. 28:5; [2 Chr. 9:8]\x*throne of the \nd Lord\nd* as king in place of David his father. And he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.
\v 24 All the leaders and the mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon.
\v 25 And the \nd Lord\nd* made Solomon very \x + \xo 29:25 \xt 2 Chr. 1:1; [Josh. 3:7] \x*great in the sight of all Israel and \x + \xo 29:25 \xt 1 Kgs. 3:13; 2 Chr. 1:12; [Eccles. 2:9]\x*bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.
\s1 The Death of David
\p
\v 26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
\v 27 The \x + \xo 29:27 \xt 2 Sam. 5:4, 5; 1 Kgs. 2:11\x*time that he reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
\v 28 Then he died \x + \xo 29:28 \xt [Gen. 15:15; 25:8] \x*at a good age, \x + \xo 29:28 \xt ch. 23:1\x*full of days, riches, and honor. And Solomon his son reigned in his place.
\v 29 Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the Chronicles \x + \xo 29:29 \xt ch. 26:28; [1 Sam. 9:9] \x*of Samuel the seer, and in the Chronicles of \x + \xo 29:29 \xt See 2 Sam. 12:1 \x*Nathan the prophet, and in the Chronicles of \x + \xo 29:29 \xt See 1 Sam. 22:5\x*Gad the seer,
\v 30 with accounts of all his rule and his might and of the circumstances \x + \xo 29:30 \xt [Dan. 4:23, 25]\x*that came upon him and upon Israel and upon all the kingdoms of the countries.
