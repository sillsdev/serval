\s1 Greeting
\p
\v 1 Paul, a servant\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or \fq slave \ft (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* of God and \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See 2 Cor. 1:1 \x*an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God’s elect and \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See 1 Tim. 2:4 \x*their knowledge of the truth, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Tim. 6:3\x*which accords with godliness,
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt 2 Tim. 1:1; Heb. 9:15; [ch. 2:13; 3:7] \x*in hope of eternal life, which God, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Num. 23:19; 2 Tim. 2:13; Heb. 6:18 \x*who never lies, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Rom. 1:2 \x*promised \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See 2 Tim. 1:9\x*before the ages began\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Greek \fq before times eternal\f*
\v 3 and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See 1 Tim. 2:6 \x*at the proper time manifested in his word \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [Rom. 10:14] \x*through the preaching \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:11 \x*with which I have been entrusted \x + \xo 1:3 \xt 1 Tim. 1:1\x*by the command of God our Savior;
\p
\v 4 To Titus, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See 3 John 4 \x*my true child in \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Jude 3; See 2 Pet. 1:1 \x*a common faith:
\p \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:2\x*Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
\s1 Qualifications for Elders
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [1 Tim. 1:3] \x*This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [Acts 14:23; 2 Tim. 2:2]\x*appoint elders in every town as I directed you—
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt For ver. 6-8, see 1 Tim. 3:2-4 \x*if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife,\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or \fq a man of one woman\f* and his children are believers\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or \fq are faithful\f* and not open to the charge of \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Eph. 5:18\x*debauchery or insubordination.
\v 7 For an overseer,\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Or \fq bishop\ft ; Greek \+tl episkopos\+tl*\f* \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Luke 12:42; 1 Cor. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:10 \x*as God’s steward, must be above reproach. He must not \x + \xo 1:7 \xt 2 Pet. 2:10 \x*be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent \x + \xo 1:7 \xt 1 Tim. 3:8; 1 Pet. 5:2\x*or greedy for gain,
\v 8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [1 Cor. 9:25]\x*and disciplined.
\v 9 He must \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [2 Thess. 2:13, 15]; See 1 Tim. 1:15; 2 Tim. 1:13 \x*hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:10\x*sound\f + \fr 1:9 \ft Or \fq healthy\ft ; also verse 13\f* doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.
\p
\v 10 For there are many who are insubordinate, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt 1 Tim. 1:6 \x*empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of \x + \xo 1:10 \xt See Acts 11:2\x*the circumcision party.\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or \fq especially those of the circumcision\f*
\v 11 They must be silenced, since \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [2 Tim. 3:6] \x*they are upsetting whole families by teaching \x + \xo 1:11 \xt 1 Tim. 6:5; 2 Pet. 2:3\x*for shameful gain what they ought not to teach.
\v 12 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [Acts 17:28]\x*One of the Cretans,\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Greek \fq One of them\f* a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Probably from Epimenides of Crete\f*
\v 13 This testimony is true. Therefore \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 2:15; 1 Tim. 5:20 \x*rebuke them \x + \xo 1:13 \xt 2 Cor. 13:10 \x*sharply, that they \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 2:1, 2\x*may be sound in the faith,
\v 14 \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:4 \x*not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See Col. 2:22 \x*the commands of people \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See 1 Tim. 6:20\x*who turn away from the truth.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Luke 11:41; 1 Tim. 4:3]; See Acts 10:15 \x*To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Rom. 14:23] \x*unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both \x + \xo 1:15 \xt See 1 Tim. 6:5\x*their minds and their consciences are defiled.
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt [1 John 2:4] \x*They profess to know God, but they \x + \xo 1:16 \xt See 1 Tim. 5:8 \x*deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, \x + \xo 1:16 \xt 2 Tim. 3:8\x*unfit for any good work.
\c 2
\s1 Teach Sound Doctrine
\p
\v 1 But as for you, teach what accords with \x + \xo 2:1 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:10\x*sound\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or \fq healthy\ft ; also verses 2, 8\f* doctrine.
\v 2 Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [1 Tim. 2:9] \x*Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, \x + \xo 2:3 \xt 1 Tim. 3:11 \x*not slanderers \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [1 Tim. 3:8; 5:23]\x*or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good,
\v 4 and so train the young women to love their husbands and children,
\v 5 to be self-controlled, \x + \xo 2:5 \xt 1 Pet. 3:2 \x*pure, \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [1 Tim. 5:14] \x*working at home, kind, and \x + \xo 2:5 \xt See Gen. 3:16 \x*submissive to their own husbands, \x + \xo 2:5 \xt See 1 Tim. 6:1\x*that the word of God may not be reviled.
\v 6 Likewise, urge \x + \xo 2:6 \xt 1 Tim. 5:1\x*the younger men to be self-controlled.
\v 7 Show yourself in all respects to be \x + \xo 2:7 \xt 1 Tim. 4:12; 1 Pet. 5:3 \x*a model of good works, and in your teaching \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [2 Cor. 11:3] \x*show integrity, \x + \xo 2:7 \xt 1 Tim. 2:2\x*dignity,
\v 8 and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [1 Tim. 6:3] \x*sound speech that cannot be condemned, \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Neh. 5:9; 1 Tim. 5:14; 1 Pet. 2:12; 3:16\x*so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.
\v 9 \x + \xo 2:9 \xt See 1 Pet. 2:18 \x*Bondservants\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Or \fq Slaves \ft (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* are to be submissive to their own masters \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [Col. 3:22]\x*in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,
\v 10 not pilfering, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [1 Tim. 3:11] \x*but showing all good faith, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Matt. 5:16; Phil. 2:15\x*so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.
\p
\v 11 For \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 3:7; See Acts 11:23 \x*the grace of God \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 3:4 \x*has appeared, bringing salvation \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [Ps. 67:2]; See 1 Tim. 2:4\x*for all people,
\v 12 training us to renounce ungodliness and \x + \xo 2:12 \xt 1 Pet. 4:2; 1 John 2:16 \x*worldly passions, and \x + \xo 2:12 \xt 2 Tim. 3:12; [Acts 24:25] \x*to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in \x + \xo 2:12 \xt 1 Tim. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:10\x*the present age,
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See 1 Cor. 1:7; 2 Pet. 3:12 \x*waiting for our blessed \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See ch. 1:2 \x*hope, the \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See 2 Thess. 2:8 \x*appearing of the glory of our great \x + \xo 2:13 \xt 2 Pet. 1:1\x*God and Savior Jesus Christ,
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See Matt. 20:28 \x*who gave himself for us to \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Ps. 130:8; See 1 Pet. 1:18 \x*redeem us from all lawlessness and \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Ezek. 37:23; See Ex. 19:5 \x*to purify for himself \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Ezek. 37:23; See Ex. 19:5 \x*a people for his own possession who are \x + \xo 2:14 \xt ch. 3:8; Eph. 2:10\x*zealous for good works.
\p
\v 15 Declare these things; exhort and \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ch. 1:13; 1 Tim. 5:20 \x*rebuke with all authority. \x + \xo 2:15 \xt See 1 Tim. 4:12\x*Let no one disregard you.
\c 3
\s1 Be Ready for Every Good Work
\p \v 1 Remind them \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Rom. 13:1; 1 Pet. 2:13 \x*to be submissive to rulers and authorities, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See 2 Tim. 2:21\x*to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
\v 2 \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Eph. 4:31 \x*to speak evil of no one, \x + \xo 3:2 \xt 1 Tim. 3:3 \x*to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and \x + \xo 3:2 \xt See 2 Tim. 2:25\x*to show perfect courtesy toward all people.
\v 3 For \x + \xo 3:3 \xt See 1 Cor. 6:11\x*we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
\v 4 But when \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See Rom. 2:4\x*the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,
\v 5 he saved us, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See Rom. 3:27 \x*not because of works done by us in righteousness, but \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Eph. 2:4; 1 Pet. 1:3 \x*according to his own mercy, by \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See John 3:5; 1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Pet. 3:21 \x*the washing of regeneration and \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See Rom. 12:2\x*renewal of the Holy Spirit,
\v 6 whom he \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Joel 2:28; Acts 2:33; 10:45; Rom. 5:5\x*poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
\v 7 so that \x + \xo 3:7 \xt ch. 2:11 \x*being justified by his grace we might become \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Rom. 8:17 \x*heirs \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See ch. 1:2\x*according to the hope of eternal life.
\v 8 The saying is \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:15 \x*trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful \x + \xo 3:8 \xt ver. 14; ch. 2:14\x*to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people.
\v 9 But \x + \xo 3:9 \xt 2 Tim. 2:16 \x*avoid foolish \x + \xo 3:9 \xt See 1 Tim. 6:4 \x*controversies, \x + \xo 3:9 \xt 1 Tim. 1:4 \x*genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for \x + \xo 3:9 \xt 2 Tim. 2:14\x*they are unprofitable and worthless.
\v 10 As for a person who stirs up division, \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See Matt. 18:15 \x*after warning him once and then twice, \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See 2 John 10\x*have nothing more to do with him,
\v 11 knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.
\s1 Final Instructions and Greetings
\p
\v 12 When I send Artemas or \x + \xo 3:12 \xt See 2 Tim. 4:12 \x*Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me \x + \xo 3:12 \xt [2 Tim. 4:10]\x*at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
\v 13 Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and \x + \xo 3:13 \xt See Acts 18:24\x*Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.
\v 14 And let our people learn \x + \xo 3:14 \xt ver. 8 \x*to devote themselves to good works, so as to help cases of urgent need, and not \x + \xo 3:14 \xt 2 Pet. 1:8; [Phil. 1:11; 4:17; Col. 1:10]\x*be unfruitful.
\p
\v 15 All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith.
\p \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See Col. 4:18\x*Grace be with you all.
