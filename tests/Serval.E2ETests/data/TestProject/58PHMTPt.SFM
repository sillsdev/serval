\s1 Greeting
\p
\v 1 Paul, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ver. 9; See Eph. 3:1 \x*a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See 1 Thess. 3:2\x*Timothy our brother,
\p To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
\v 2 and Apphia our sister and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Col. 4:17 \x*Archippus our \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Phil. 2:25 \x*fellow soldier, and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See Rom. 16:5\x*the church in your house:
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See Rom. 1:7\x*Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
\s1 Philemon’s Love and Faith
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt See Rom. 1:8, 9\x*I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
\v 5 because I \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Col. 1:4 \x*hear of your love and \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Eph. 1:15\x*of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,
\v 6 and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Phil. 1:9; Col. 1:9\x*knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.\f + \fr 6 \ft Or \fq for Christ’s service\f*
\v 7 For I have derived much joy and \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [2 Cor. 7:4, 13; Col. 4:11] \x*comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ver. 20; 2 Tim. 1:16; [Rom. 15:32; 2 Cor. 7:13]\x*have been refreshed through you.
\s1 Paul’s Plea for Onesimus
\p
\v 8 Accordingly, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [1 Thess. 2:6] \x*though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Eph. 5:4\x*what is required,
\v 9 yet for love’s sake I prefer to appeal to you—I, Paul, an old man and now \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ver. 1\x*a prisoner also for Christ Jesus—
\v 10 I appeal to you for \x + \xo 1:10 \xt See 3 John 4 \x*my child, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Col. 4:9 \x*Onesimus,\f + \fr 10 \fq Onesimus \ft means \fq useful \ft (see verse 11) or \fq beneficial \ft (see verse 20)\f* \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ver. 13; 1 Cor. 4:15; [Gal. 4:19]\x*whose father I became in my imprisonment.
\v 11 (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)
\v 12 I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
\v 13 I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me \x + \xo 1:13 \xt See 1 Cor. 16:17 \x*on your behalf \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ver. 10; See Phil. 1:7\x*during my imprisonment for the gospel,
\v 14 but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [2 Cor. 9:7; 1 Pet. 5:2]\x*by compulsion but of your own accord.
\v 15 For this perhaps is why \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Gen. 45:5, 8]\x*he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt See 1 Cor. 7:22 \x*no longer as a bondservant\f + \fr 16 \ft Or \fq slave\ft ; twice in this verse (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* but more than a bondservant, as \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Matt. 23:8; Col. 4:9; 1 Tim. 6:2 \x*a beloved brother—especially to me, but how much more to you, \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Col. 3:22, 23; [Eph. 6:5]\x*both in the flesh and in the Lord.
\p
\v 17 So if you consider me \x + \xo 1:17 \xt 2 Cor. 8:23\x*your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
\v 18 If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19 \xt See 1 Cor. 16:21\x*I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it—to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
\v 20 Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. \x + \xo 1:20 \xt See ver. 7\x*Refresh my heart in Christ.
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21 \xt See 2 Cor. 2:3\x*Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
\v 22 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for \x + \xo 1:22 \xt Phil. 1:25; 2:24 \x*I am hoping that \x + \xo 1:22 \xt See 2 Cor. 1:11 \x*through your prayers \x + \xo 1:22 \xt [Heb. 13:19]\x*I will be graciously given to you.
\s1 Final Greetings
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23 \xt See Col. 1:7 \x*Epaphras, my \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Rom. 16:7\x*fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
\v 24 and so do \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See Col. 4:10 \x*Mark, \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See Col. 4:10 \x*Aristarchus, \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:10, 11\x*Demas, and \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See Col. 4:14; 2 Tim. 4:10, 11\x*Luke, my fellow workers.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 1:25 \xt See Gal. 6:18\x*The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
