\s1 The Supremacy of God’s Son
\p \v 1 Long ago, at many times and \x + \xo 1:1 \xt [Num. 12:6, 8; Joel 2:28]\x*in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
\v 2 but \x + \xo 1:2 \xt 1 Pet. 1:20; [ch. 9:26; Acts 2:17] \x*in these last days \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 2:3 \x*he has spoken to us by \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See Matt. 14:33 \x*his Son, whom he appointed \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Ps. 2:8; Matt. 21:38; See Matt. 28:18 \x*the heir of all things, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [ch. 3:3]; See John 1:3 \x*through whom also he created \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 11:3\x*the world.
\v 3 He is the radiance of the glory of God and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See 2 Cor. 4:4 \x*the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See ch. 9:14 \x*After making purification for sins, \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See Mark 16:19 \x*he sat down \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [Luke 22:69]\x*at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
\v 4 having become as much superior to angels as the name \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Eph. 1:21; Phil. 2:9\x*he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
\p
\v 5 For to which of the angels did God ever say,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt ch. 5:5; Acts 13:33; Cited from Ps. 2:7 \x*“You are my Son,
\q2 today I have begotten you”?
\b
\m Or again,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Cited from 2 Sam. 7:14; [Ps. 89:26, 27]\x*“I will be to him a father,
\q2 and he shall be to me a son”?
\b
\m
\v 6 And again, when he brings \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Rom. 8:29 \x*the firstborn into the world, he says,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Cited from Deut. 32:43 (Gk.); [Ps. 97:7]\x*“Let all God’s angels worship him.”
\b
\m
\v 7 Of the angels he says,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Cited from Ps. 104:4\x*“He makes his angels winds,
\q2 and his ministers a flame of fire.”
\b
\m
\v 8 But of the Son he says,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Cited from Ps. 45:6, 7\x*“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,
\q2 the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
\q1
\v 9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness;
\q1 therefore God, your God, \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Isa. 61:1 \x*has anointed you
\q2 with \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Isa. 61:3\x*the oil of gladness beyond your companions.”
\b
\m
\v 10 And,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Cited from Ps. 102:25-27\x*“You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning,
\q2 and the heavens are the work of your hands;
\q1
\v 11 they will perish, but you remain;
\q2 they will all wear out like a garment,
\q1
\v 12 like a robe you will roll them up,
\q2 like a garment they will be changed.\f + \fr 1:12 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq like a garment\f*
\q1 But you are \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ch. 13:8\x*the same,
\q2 and your years will have no end.”
\b
\m
\v 13 And to which of the angels has he ever said,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 1:13 \xt Cited from Ps. 110:1 \x*“Sit at my right hand
\q2 \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 10:13\x*until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?
\b
\m
\v 14 Are they not all ministering spirits \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Gen. 19:16; 28:12; 32:1, 2; Judg. 6:11; 13:3; Ps. 34:7; 91:11; 103:20, 21; Dan. 3:28; 6:22; 10:11; Matt. 18:10 \x*sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See Matt. 25:34\x*inherit salvation?
\c 2
\s1 Warning Against Neglecting Salvation
\p
\v 1 Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
\v 2 For since \x + \xo 2:2 \xt See Acts 7:53 \x*the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [ch. 10:28; Num. 15:30, 31; Deut. 4:3; 17:2, 5, 12; 27:26] \x*every transgression or disobedience received a just \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 10:35; 11:26\x*retribution,
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [ch. 10:28, 29; 12:25] \x*how shall we escape if we \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Matt. 22:5 (Gk.) \x*neglect such a great salvation? It was \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 1:2 \x*declared at first by the Lord, and it was \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Mark 16:20; [Acts 5:32] \x*attested to us \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Luke 1:2]\x*by those who heard,
\v 4 \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*while God also bore witness \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Acts 2:22, 43 \x*by signs and wonders and various miracles and by \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [1 Cor. 12:4, 11] \x*gifts of the Holy Spirit \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [Eph. 1:5]\x*distributed according to his will.
\s1 The Founder of Salvation
\p
\v 5 For it was not to angels that God subjected the world \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ch. 6:5\x*to come, of which we are speaking.
\v 6 It has been testified somewhere,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Cited from Ps. 8:4-6\x*“What is man, that you are mindful of him,
\q2 or the son of man, that you care for him?
\q1
\v 7 You made him for a little while lower than the angels;
\q2 you have crowned him with glory and honor,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Some manuscripts insert \fq and set him over the works of your hands\f*
\q2
\v 8 putting everything in subjection under his feet.”
\b
\m Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [1 Cor. 15:25]\x*we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.
\v 9 But we see him \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ver. 7 \x*who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Acts 3:13; 1 Pet. 1:21; See Acts 2:33 \x*crowned with glory and honor \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Phil. 2:7-9; See John 10:17 \x*because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Matt. 16:28; John 8:52 \x*taste death \x + \xo 2:9 \xt See John 12:32\x*for everyone.
\p
\v 10 For it \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [Luke 24:26] \x*was fitting that he, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Rom. 11:36 \x*for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ch. 3:1; Rom. 8:30] \x*to glory, should make the \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ch. 5:9] \x*founder of their salvation \x + \xo 2:10 \xt ch. 5:9; 7:28; Luke 13:32; [Phil. 3:12]\x*perfect through suffering.
\v 11 For \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 13:12 \x*he who sanctifies and \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 10:10, 14, 29 \x*those who are sanctified \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Acts 17:28 \x*all have one source.\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Greek \fq all are of one\f* That is why he is not ashamed to call them \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Matt. 25:40\x*brothers,\f + \fr 2:11 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church; also verse 12\f*
\v 12 saying,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Cited from Ps. 22:22 \x*“I will tell of your name to my brothers;
\q2 in the midst of the \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ch. 12:23\x*congregation I will sing your praise.”
\b
\m
\v 13 And again,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Ps. 18:2; Isa. 8:17; 12:2] \x*“I will put my trust in him.”
\b
\m And again,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Cited from Isa. 8:18 \x*“Behold, I and the children \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See John 17:2\x*God has given me.”
\b
\p
\v 14 Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See John 1:14 \x*partook of the same things, that \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See 1 Cor. 15:54-56 \x*through death he might \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Col. 2:15; 2 Tim. 1:10] \x*destroy \x + \xo 2:14 \xt 1 John 3:8; [John 16:11]\x*the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
\v 15 and deliver all those who \x + \xo 2:15 \xt See Rom. 8:15\x*through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
\v 16 For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Isa. 41:8, 9; [ch. 8:9]\x*helps the offspring of Abraham.
\v 17 Therefore he had \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Phil. 2:7 \x*to be made like his brothers in every respect, \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ch. 4:15, 16; [ch. 5:2, 7, 8] \x*so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ch. 5:1; Rom. 15:17\x*in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
\v 18 For because he himself has suffered \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ch. 4:15; Luke 22:28\x*when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
\c 3
\s1 Jesus Greater Than Moses
\p \v 1 Therefore, holy brothers,\f + \fr 3:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verse 12\f* you who share in \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Eph. 4:1; Phil. 3:14 \x*a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [John 20:21; Rom. 15:8]\x*the apostle and high priest of our confession,
\v 2 who was faithful to him who appointed him, \x + \xo 3:2 \xt ver. 5\x*just as Moses also was faithful in all God’s\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Greek \fq his\ft ; also verses 5, 6\f* house.
\v 3 For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses—as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
\v 4 (For every house is built by someone, but \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Eph. 2:10; 3:9\x*the builder of all things is God.)
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5 \xt ver. 2; Cited from Num. 12:7 \x*Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Ex. 14:31; Deut. 34:5; Josh. 1:2; 8:31; Ps. 105:26; Rev. 15:3 \x*as a servant, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Deut. 18:15, 18, 19\x*to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,
\v 6 but Christ is faithful over God’s house as \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See ch. 1:2 \x*a son. And \x + \xo 3:6 \xt 1 Cor. 3:16; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16; Eph. 2:21; 1 Tim. 3:15; 1 Pet. 2:5 \x*we are his house if indeed we \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ver. 14; ch. 6:11; Ps. 119:33, 112; Matt. 10:22; Rev. 2:26\x*hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.\f + \fr 3:6 \ft Some manuscripts insert \fq firm to the end\f*
\s1 A Rest for the People of God
\p
\v 7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt ver. 15; ch. 4:7; Cited from Ps. 95:7-11\x*“Today, if you hear his voice,
\q1
\v 8 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,
\q2 on the day of testing in the wilderness,
\q1
\v 9 where your fathers put me to the test
\q2 and saw my works for \x + \xo 3:9 \xt See Acts 7:36\x*forty years.
\q1
\v 10 Therefore I was provoked with that generation,
\q1 and said, ‘They always go astray in their heart;
\q2 they have not known my ways.’
\q1
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt ch. 4:3, 5\x*As I swore in my wrath,
\q2 ‘They shall not enter my rest.’”
\b
\m
\v 12 Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from \x + \xo 3:12 \xt See Matt. 16:16\x*the living God.
\v 13 But \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [ch. 10:24, 25] \x*exhort one another every day, as long as it is called “today,” that none of you may be hardened by \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [Isa. 44:20; Rom. 7:11; Eph. 4:22]\x*the deceitfulness of sin.
\v 14 For we have come to share in Christ, \x + \xo 3:14 \xt ver. 6; ch. 10:23; 1 Cor. 15:2\x*if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.
\v 15 As it is said,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [See ver. 7 above]\x*“Today, if you hear his voice,
\q1 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.”
\b
\m
\v 16 For \x + \xo 3:16 \xt Num. 14:2; Deut. 1:34, 35 \x*who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not \x + \xo 3:16 \xt [Num. 14:24, 30; Deut. 1:36, 38]\x*all those who left Egypt led by Moses?
\v 17 And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt Num. 14:29; See Jude 5\x*whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
\v 18 And to whom did he swear that \x + \xo 3:18 \xt Deut. 1:34, 35; [ch. 4:2]\x*they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
\v 19 So we see that \x + \xo 3:19 \xt ch. 4:6; Ps. 78:22; 106:24\x*they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
\c 4
\p \v 1 Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 12:15\x*to have failed to reach it.
\v 2 For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because \x + \xo 4:2 \xt Rom. 3:3\x*they were not united by faith with those who listened.\f + \fr 4:2 \ft Some manuscripts \fq it did not meet with faith in the hearers\f*
\v 3 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 4:3 \xt ch. 3:11; Cited from Ps. 95:11\x*“As I swore in my wrath,
\q1 ‘They shall not enter my rest,’”
\b
\m although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
\v 4 For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: \x + \xo 4:4 \xt Cited from Gen. 2:2; [Ex. 20:11; 31:17]\x*“And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.”
\v 5 And again in this passage he said,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 4:5 \xt ver. 3\x*“They shall not enter my rest.”
\b
\m
\v 6 Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news \x + \xo 4:6 \xt See ch. 3:19\x*failed to enter because of disobedience,
\v 7 again he appoints a certain day, “Today,” saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 4:7 \xt See ch. 3:7, 8\x*“Today, if you hear his voice,
\q1 do not harden your hearts.”
\b
\m
\v 8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God\f + \fr 4:8 \ft Greek \fq he\f* would not have spoken of another day later on.
\v 9 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,
\v 10 for whoever has entered God’s rest has also \x + \xo 4:10 \xt [Rev. 14:13]\x*rested from his works as God did from his.
\p
\v 11 Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so \x + \xo 4:11 \xt [ch. 3:12]\x*that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
\v 12 For \x + \xo 4:12 \xt 1 Pet. 1:23 \x*the word of God is living and \x + \xo 4:12 \xt [Jer. 23:29; 1 Thess. 2:13] \x*active, \x + \xo 4:12 \xt Isa. 49:2; Eph. 6:17 \x*sharper than any \x + \xo 4:12 \xt Prov. 5:4; Rev. 1:16; 2:12 \x*two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and \x + \xo 4:12 \xt [1 Cor. 14:24, 25]\x*discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
\v 13 And \x + \xo 4:13 \xt 2 Chr. 16:9; Job 34:21; Ps. 33:13-15 \x*no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Job 26:6\x*naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
\s1 Jesus the Great High Priest
\p
\v 14 Since then we have \x + \xo 4:14 \xt ch. 2:17, 18; [ch. 10:21] \x*a great high priest \x + \xo 4:14 \xt Eph. 4:10 \x*who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, \x + \xo 4:14 \xt ch. 10:23\x*let us hold fast our confession.
\v 15 For we do not have a high priest \x + \xo 4:15 \xt [ch. 5:2; Isa. 53:3] \x*who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been \x + \xo 4:15 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*tempted as we are, \x + \xo 4:15 \xt ch. 9:28; 1 Pet. 2:22; 1 John 3:5; [ch. 7:26; John 8:46; 14:30]\x*yet without sin.
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16 \xt ch. 10:19; Eph. 3:12; [ch. 7:19, 25]\x*Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
\c 5
\p \v 1 For every high priest chosen from among men \x + \xo 5:1 \xt ch. 8:3 \x*is appointed to act on behalf of men \x + \xo 5:1 \xt ch. 2:17 \x*in relation to God, \x + \xo 5:1 \xt ch. 8:3, 4; 9:9; 10:11; 11:4\x*to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2 \xt ch. 2:18; 4:15 \x*He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [ch. 7:28]\x*is beset with weakness.
\v 3 Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins \x + \xo 5:3 \xt ch. 7:27; 9:7; Lev. 4:3; 9:7; 16:6\x*just as he does for those of the people.
\v 4 And \x + \xo 5:4 \xt Num. 16:5, 40; 18:7; 2 Chr. 26:18 \x*no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, \x + \xo 5:4 \xt Ex. 28:1; 1 Chr. 23:13\x*just as Aaron was.
\p
\v 5 So also Christ \x + \xo 5:5 \xt John 8:54 \x*did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 5:5 \xt See ch. 1:5\x*“You are my Son,
\q2 today I have begotten you”;
\b
\m
\v 6 as he says also in another place,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 5:6 \xt ch. 7:17, 21; Cited from Ps. 110:4\x*“You are a priest forever,
\q2 after the order of Melchizedek.”
\b
\p
\v 7 In the days of his flesh, \x + \xo 5:7 \xt Matt. 26:39, 44; Mark 14:36, 39; Luke 22:41, 44 \x*Jesus\f + \fr 5:7 \ft Greek \fq he\f* offered up prayers and supplications, \x + \xo 5:7 \xt Ps. 22:1, 2; [Matt. 27:46, 50; Mark 15:34, 37; Luke 23:46] \x*with loud cries and tears, to him \x + \xo 5:7 \xt Mark 14:36 \x*who was able to save him from death, and \x + \xo 5:7 \xt Ps. 22:24\x*he was heard because of his reverence.
\v 8 Although \x + \xo 5:8 \xt See ch. 1:2 \x*he was a son, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Phil. 2:8\x*he learned obedience through what he suffered.
\v 9 And \x + \xo 5:9 \xt See ch. 2:10\x*being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,
\v 10 being designated by God a high priest \x + \xo 5:10 \xt ver. 6; ch. 6:20\x*after the order of Melchizedek.
\s1 Warning Against Apostasy
\p
\v 11 About this we have much to say, and it is \x + \xo 5:11 \xt [2 Pet. 3:16]\x*hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
\v 12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again \x + \xo 5:12 \xt ch. 6:1 \x*the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need \x + \xo 5:12 \xt 1 Cor. 3:2\x*milk, not solid food,
\v 13 for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is \x + \xo 5:13 \xt 1 Cor. 3:1; [1 Pet. 2:2]\x*a child.
\v 14 But solid food is for \x + \xo 5:14 \xt Eph. 4:13 \x*the mature, for those who have their powers \x + \xo 5:14 \xt Gen. 3:22; 1 Kgs. 3:9; Isa. 7:15\x*of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.

\p \v 1 Therefore \x + \xo 6:1 \xt [Phil. 3:12-14] \x*let us leave \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 5:12 \x*the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 9:14\x*from dead works and of faith toward God,
\v 2 and of \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Acts 19:4, 5 \x*instruction about washings,\f + \fr 6:2 \ft Or \fq baptisms \ft (that is, cleansing rites)\f* \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Acts 8:17; 19:6 \x*the laying on of hands, \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Acts 17:31, 32 \x*the resurrection of the dead, and \x + \xo 6:2 \xt See Acts 10:42\x*eternal judgment.
\v 3 And this we will do \x + \xo 6:3 \xt See 1 Cor. 16:7\x*if God permits.
\v 4 For it is impossible, in the case of those \x + \xo 6:4 \xt ch. 10:32 \x*who have once been enlightened, who have tasted \x + \xo 6:4 \xt [John 4:10; Eph. 2:8] \x*the heavenly gift, and \x + \xo 6:4 \xt ch. 2:4, 5; Gal. 3:2, 5\x*have shared in the Holy Spirit,
\v 5 and \x + \xo 6:5 \xt Ps. 34:8\x*have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,
\v 6 and \x + \xo 6:6 \xt [Matt. 19:26]; See 1 John 5:16 \x*then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since \x + \xo 6:6 \xt [ch. 10:29]\x*they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.
\v 7 For \x + \xo 6:7 \xt Ps. 65:10\x*land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
\v 8 But \x + \xo 6:8 \xt Isa. 5:1-7; [Gen. 3:17, 18; Deut. 29:22, 23; Jer. 44:22; Luke 13:6-9] \x*if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, \x + \xo 6:8 \xt [Mal. 4:1; John 15:6]\x*and its end is to be burned.
\p
\v 9 Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things—things that belong to salvation.
\v 10 For \x + \xo 6:10 \xt Prov. 19:17; Matt. 10:42; 25:40; Mark 9:41 \x*God is not unjust so as to overlook \x + \xo 6:10 \xt 1 Thess. 1:3 \x*your work and the love that you have shown for his name in \x + \xo 6:10 \xt Rom. 15:31; 2 Cor. 8:4; 9:1, 12; 2 Tim. 1:18; Rev. 2:19\x*serving the saints, as you still do.
\v 11 And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance \x + \xo 6:11 \xt Rom. 5:2-5\x*of hope until the end,
\v 12 so that you may not be sluggish, but \x + \xo 6:12 \xt ch. 13:7; [ch. 10:36]\x*imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
\s1 The Certainty of God’s Promise
\p
\v 13 For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, \x + \xo 6:13 \xt Gen. 22:16\x*he swore by himself,
\v 14 saying, \x + \xo 6:14 \xt Cited from Gen. 22:17\x*“Surely I will bless you and multiply you.”
\v 15 And thus Abraham,\f + \fr 6:15 \ft Greek \fq he\f* \x + \xo 6:15 \xt ver. 12, 17; [ch. 7:6]; See Rom. 4:13\x*having patiently waited, obtained the promise.
\v 16 For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes \x + \xo 6:16 \xt Ex. 22:11\x*an oath is final for confirmation.
\v 17 So when God desired to show more convincingly to \x + \xo 6:17 \xt ch. 11:9 \x*the heirs of the promise \x + \xo 6:17 \xt ver. 18; [Ps. 110:4; Prov. 19:21] \x*the unchangeable character of his purpose, \x + \xo 6:17 \xt [Gal. 3:20]\x*he guaranteed it with an oath,
\v 18 so that by two unchangeable things, in which \x + \xo 6:18 \xt See Titus 1:2 \x*it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope \x + \xo 6:18 \xt ch. 12:1, 2\x*set before us.
\v 19 We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into \x + \xo 6:19 \xt ch. 9:7; Lev. 16:15\x*the inner place behind the curtain,
\v 20 where Jesus has gone \x + \xo 6:20 \xt ch. 4:14; 8:1; 9:24 \x*as a forerunner on our behalf, \x + \xo 6:20 \xt ch. 3:1; 5:6, 10; 7:17, 21\x*having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
\c 7
\s1 The Priestly Order of Melchizedek
\p \v 1 For this \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Gen. 14:18-20 \x*Melchizedek, king of \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Ps. 76:2 \x*Salem, priest of \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Num. 24:16; Deut. 32:8\x*the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
\v 2 and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.
\v 3 He is without father or mother \x + \xo 7:3 \xt [ver. 6]\x*or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.
\p
\v 4 See how great this man was to whom Abraham \x + \xo 7:4 \xt [Acts 2:29; 7:8, 9]\x*the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils!
\v 5 And \x + \xo 7:5 \xt Num. 18:21, 26; 2 Chr. 31:4, 5\x*those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers,\f + \fr 7:5 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* though these also are descended from Abraham.
\v 6 But this man \x + \xo 7:6 \xt [ver. 3] \x*who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed \x + \xo 7:6 \xt See Rom. 4:13\x*him who had the promises.
\v 7 It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.
\v 8 In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one \x + \xo 7:8 \xt [ch. 5:6; 6:20] \x*of whom it is testified that \x + \xo 7:8 \xt [John 6:57; Rev. 1:17, 18]\x*he lives.
\v 9 One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,
\v 10 for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
\s1 Jesus Compared to Melchizedek
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11 \xt ver. 18, 19; ch. 8:7; [Gal. 2:21]\x*Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?
\v 12 For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
\v 13 For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
\v 14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended \x + \xo 7:14 \xt Isa. 11:1; Mic. 5:2; Matt. 1:3; Luke 3:33; Rev. 5:5\x*from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
\p
\v 15 This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,
\v 16 who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.
\v 17 For it is witnessed of him,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 7:17 \xt ver. 21; ch. 5:6; 6:20; Cited from Ps. 110:4\x*“You are a priest forever,
\q2 after the order of Melchizedek.”
\b
\m
\v 18 For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside \x + \xo 7:18 \xt Rom. 8:3; Gal. 4:9\x*because of its weakness and uselessness
\v 19 (for \x + \xo 7:19 \xt ch. 9:9; 10:1; Lev. 16:16; See Acts 13:39 \x*the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, \x + \xo 7:19 \xt ch. 6:18 \x*a better hope is introduced, through which \x + \xo 7:19 \xt [ver. 25; Lev. 10:3]; See ch. 4:16\x*we draw near to God.
\p
\v 20 And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath,
\v 21 but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him:
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 7:21 \xt See ver. 17\x*“The Lord has sworn
\q2 and will not change his mind,
\q1 ‘You are a priest forever.’”
\b
\m
\v 22 This makes Jesus the guarantor of \x + \xo 7:22 \xt ch. 8:6\x*a better covenant.
\p
\v 23 The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,
\v 24 but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues \x + \xo 7:24 \xt ver. 21, 28\x*forever.
\v 25 Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost\f + \fr 7:25 \ft That is, completely; or \fq at all times\f* \x + \xo 7:25 \xt [ver. 19] \x*those who draw near to God \x + \xo 7:25 \xt [John 14:6] \x*through him, since he always lives \x + \xo 7:25 \xt ch. 9:24; See Rom. 8:34\x*to make intercession for them.
\p
\v 26 For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, \x + \xo 7:26 \xt Ps. 16:10; Rev. 15:4; 16:5; [Mark 1:24] \x*holy, innocent, unstained, \x + \xo 7:26 \xt See ch. 4:15 \x*separated from sinners, and \x + \xo 7:26 \xt [ch. 8:1]; See ch. 4:14\x*exalted above the heavens.
\v 27 He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, \x + \xo 7:27 \xt See ch. 5:3 \x*first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this \x + \xo 7:27 \xt ch. 9:12; 10:10; [ch. 9:28]\x*once for all when he offered up himself.
\v 28 For the law appoints men \x + \xo 7:28 \xt [ch. 5:2] \x*in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made \x + \xo 7:28 \xt ch. 2:10; 5:9\x*perfect forever.
\c 8
\s1 Jesus, High Priest of a Better Covenant
\p \v 1 Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, \x + \xo 8:1 \xt See Mark 16:19\x*one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
\v 2 a minister in the holy places, in \x + \xo 8:2 \xt ch. 9:24; [ch. 9:11] \x*the true tent\f + \fr 8:2 \ft Or \fq tabernacle\ft ; also verse 5\f* that the Lord \x + \xo 8:2 \xt Ex. 33:7\x*set up, not man.
\v 3 For \x + \xo 8:3 \xt See ch. 5:1 \x*every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus \x + \xo 8:3 \xt ch. 9:12-14; 10:9-12; Eph. 5:2\x*it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
\v 4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
\v 5 They serve \x + \xo 8:5 \xt ch. 9:23 \x*a copy and \x + \xo 8:5 \xt ch. 10:1; Col. 2:17 \x*shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, \x + \xo 8:5 \xt Cited from Ex. 25:40\x*“See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”
\v 6 But as it is, Christ\f + \fr 8:6 \ft Greek \fq he\f* has obtained a ministry that is \x + \xo 8:6 \xt ch. 1:4; 2 Cor. 3:6-11 \x*as much more excellent than the old as \x + \xo 8:6 \xt ch. 7:22 \x*the covenant \x + \xo 8:6 \xt ch. 9:15; 12:24; [Gal. 3:19]\x*he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.
\v 7 \x + \xo 8:7 \xt See ch. 7:11\x*For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.
\p
\v 8 For he finds fault with them when he says:\f + \fr 8:8 \ft Some manuscripts \fq For finding fault with it he says to them\f*
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 8:8 \xt Cited from Jer. 31:31-34\x*“Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord,
\q2 when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel
\q2 and with the house of Judah,
\q1
\v 9 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers
\q2 on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.
\q1 For they did not continue in my covenant,
\q2 and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 8:10 \xt ch. 10:16; Rom. 11:27 \x*For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel
\q2 after those days, declares the Lord:
\q1 I will put my laws into their minds,
\q2 and \x + \xo 8:10 \xt [2 Cor. 3:3]\x*write them on their hearts,
\q1 and I will be their God,
\q2 and they shall be my people.
\q1
\v 11 And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor
\q2 and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’
\q1 for they shall \x + \xo 8:11 \xt Isa. 54:13; John 6:45; 1 John 2:27\x*all know me,
\q2 from the least of them to the greatest.
\q1
\v 12 For I will be merciful toward their iniquities,
\q2 \x + \xo 8:12 \xt ch. 10:17; Rom. 11:27\x*and I will remember their sins no more.”
\b
\m
\v 13 In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And \x + \xo 8:13 \xt [2 Cor. 5:17]\x*what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
\c 9
\s1 The Earthly Holy Place
\p \v 1 Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and \x + \xo 9:1 \xt Ex. 25:8\x*an earthly place of holiness.
\v 2 For \x + \xo 9:2 \xt Ex. 26:1 \x*a tent\f + \fr 9:2 \ft Or \fq tabernacle\ft ; also verses 11, 21\f* was prepared, the first section, in which were \x + \xo 9:2 \xt Ex. 25:31-39; 26:35; 40:4 \x*the lampstand and \x + \xo 9:2 \xt Ex. 25:23-29 \x*the table and \x + \xo 9:2 \xt Ex. 25:30; Lev. 24:5-8\x*the bread of the Presence.\f + \fr 9:2 \ft Greek \fq the presentation of the loaves\f* It is called the Holy Place.
\v 3 Behind \x + \xo 9:3 \xt Ex. 26:31-33; 40:3, 21\x*the second curtain was a second section\f + \fr 9:3 \ft Greek \fq tent\ft ; also verses 6, 8\f* called the Most Holy Place,
\v 4 having the golden \x + \xo 9:4 \xt Lev. 16:12, 13 \x*altar of incense and \x + \xo 9:4 \xt Ex. 25:10; 26:33; 40:3, 21; Rev. 11:19 \x*the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was \x + \xo 9:4 \xt Ex. 16:33, 34 \x*a golden urn holding the manna, and \x + \xo 9:4 \xt Num. 17:10 \x*Aaron’s staff that budded, and \x + \xo 9:4 \xt Ex. 25:16; 40:20; Deut. 10:2, 5; 1 Kgs. 8:9, 21; 2 Chr. 5:10\x*the tablets of the covenant.
\v 5 Above it were \x + \xo 9:5 \xt Ex. 25:18-22; [1 Kgs. 8:6, 7] \x*the cherubim of glory overshadowing \x + \xo 9:5 \xt Lev. 16:2\x*the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
\p
\v 6 These preparations having thus been made, \x + \xo 9:6 \xt [Num. 28:3]\x*the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties,
\v 7 but into the second only \x + \xo 9:7 \xt Lev. 16:15, 34; [ch. 10:3; Ex. 30:10] \x*the high priest goes, and he but \x + \xo 9:7 \xt Lev. 16:15, 34; [ch. 10:3; Ex. 30:10] \x*once a year, and not without taking blood, \x + \xo 9:7 \xt See ch. 5:3\x*which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.
\v 8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that \x + \xo 9:8 \xt ch. 10:20; [John 14:6]\x*the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing
\v 9 (which is symbolic for the present age).\f + \fr 9:9 \ft Or \fq which is symbolic for the age then present\f* According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered \x + \xo 9:9 \xt See ch. 7:19\x*that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,
\v 10 but deal only with \x + \xo 9:10 \xt See Lev. 11:2 \x*food and drink and \x + \xo 9:10 \xt Mark 7:4, 8; See Lev. 11:25\x*various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.
\s1 Redemption Through the Blood of Christ
\p
\v 11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest \x + \xo 9:11 \xt ch. 10:1 \x*of the good things that have come,\f + \fr 9:11 \ft Some manuscripts \fq good things to come\f* then through \x + \xo 9:11 \xt [ver. 24; ch. 8:2] \x*the greater and more perfect tent (\x + \xo 9:11 \xt See Mark 14:58\x*not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)
\v 12 he \x + \xo 9:12 \xt ver. 24 \x*entered \x + \xo 9:12 \xt ch. 7:27; 10:10 \x*once for all into the holy places, not by means of \x + \xo 9:12 \xt ch. 10:4 \x*the blood of goats and calves but \x + \xo 9:12 \xt See Acts 20:28 \x*by means of his own blood, \x + \xo 9:12 \xt Job 33:24; [Dan. 9:24; 1 Cor. 6:20]\x*thus securing an eternal redemption.
\v 13 For if \x + \xo 9:13 \xt Lev. 16:14-16 \x*the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with \x + \xo 9:13 \xt Num. 19:2, 17, 18\x*the ashes of a heifer, sanctify\f + \fr 9:13 \ft Or \fq For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies\f* for the purification of the flesh,
\v 14 how much more will \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ver. 12; 1 John 1:7; Rev. 7:14 \x*the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ch. 7:27; 8:3 \x*offered himself without blemish to God, \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ch. 1:3; 10:22 \x*purify our\f + \fr 9:14 \ft Some manuscripts \fq your\f* conscience \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ch. 6:1 \x*from dead works \x + \xo 9:14 \xt Rom. 6:13; 1 Pet. 4:2\x*to serve the living God.
\p
\v 15 Therefore he is \x + \xo 9:15 \xt ch. 8:6; 12:24 \x*the mediator of a new covenant, so that \x + \xo 9:15 \xt [ch. 3:1]; See Rom. 8:28 \x*those who are called may \x + \xo 9:15 \xt [ch. 10:36; Ex. 32:13] \x*receive the promised eternal inheritance, \x + \xo 9:15 \xt Rom. 3:24, 25; 5:6\x*since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.\f + \fr 9:15 \ft The Greek word means both \fq covenant \ft and \fq will\ft ; also verses 16, 17\f*
\v 16 For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.
\v 17 For \x + \xo 9:17 \xt [Gal. 3:15]\x*a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.
\v 18 Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated \x + \xo 9:18 \xt Ex. 24:6, 8\x*without blood.
\v 19 For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took \x + \xo 9:19 \xt ver. 12 \x*the blood of calves and goats, \x + \xo 9:19 \xt [Lev. 14:4, 7; Num. 19:6, 17]\x*with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
\v 20 saying, \x + \xo 9:20 \xt Cited from Ex. 24:8; [Matt. 26:28]\x*“This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.”
\v 21 And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both \x + \xo 9:21 \xt [Ex. 29:12, 36; Lev. 8:15, 19; 16:14, 16; 2 Chr. 29:22]\x*the tent and all the vessels used in worship.
\v 22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and \x + \xo 9:22 \xt Lev. 17:11\x*without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
\p
\v 23 Thus it was necessary for \x + \xo 9:23 \xt ch. 8:5\x*the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
\v 24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places \x + \xo 9:24 \xt ch. 8:2; [ver. 11] \x*made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God \x + \xo 9:24 \xt ch. 7:25; See Rom. 8:34\x*on our behalf.
\v 25 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as \x + \xo 9:25 \xt See ver. 7 \x*the high priest enters \x + \xo 9:25 \xt ch. 10:19\x*the holy places every year with blood not his own,
\v 26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, \x + \xo 9:26 \xt 1 John 3:5 \x*he has appeared \x + \xo 9:26 \xt ver. 12; ch. 7:27; 10:10; 1 Pet. 3:18 \x*once for all \x + \xo 9:26 \xt [ch. 1:2; 1 Cor. 10:11]\x*at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
\v 27 And just as \x + \xo 9:27 \xt See Gen. 3:19 \x*it is appointed for man to die once, and \x + \xo 9:27 \xt See Matt. 16:27\x*after that comes judgment,
\v 28 so Christ, having been offered once \x + \xo 9:28 \xt Isa. 53:12; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18 \x*to bear the sins of \x + \xo 9:28 \xt Matt. 20:28; 26:28; Mark 10:45; Rev. 5:9 \x*many, will appear \x + \xo 9:28 \xt Acts 1:11 \x*a second time, \x + \xo 9:28 \xt See ch. 4:15 \x*not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly \x + \xo 9:28 \xt Titus 2:13; [Isa. 25:9]\x*waiting for him.
\c 10
\s1 Christ’s Sacrifice Once for All
\p \v 1 For since the law has but \x + \xo 10:1 \xt ch. 8:5; Col. 2:17 \x*a shadow \x + \xo 10:1 \xt ch. 9:11 \x*of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, \x + \xo 10:1 \xt [ch. 9:9]\x*it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.
\v 2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
\v 3 But \x + \xo 10:3 \xt See ch. 9:7 \x*in these sacrifices \x + \xo 10:3 \xt Lev. 16:21\x*there is a reminder of sins every year.
\v 4 For \x + \xo 10:4 \xt ver. 11\x*it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
\p
\v 5 Consequently, \x + \xo 10:5 \xt [ch. 1:6] \x*when Christ\f + \fr 10:5 \ft Greek \fq he\f* came into the world, he said,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 10:5 \xt Cited from Ps. 40:6-8\x*“Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired,
\q2 but a body have you prepared for me;
\q1
\v 6 in burnt offerings and sin offerings
\q2 you have taken no pleasure.
\q1
\v 7 Then I said, ‘Behold, I have come to do your will, O God,
\q2 as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.’”
\b
\m
\v 8 When he said above, “You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in \x + \xo 10:8 \xt [See ver. 5 above]\x*sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings” (these are offered according to the law),
\v 9 then he added, \x + \xo 10:9 \xt ver. 7\x*“Behold, I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second.
\v 10 And by that will \x + \xo 10:10 \xt ch. 2:11; 13:12 \x*we have been sanctified through the offering of \x + \xo 10:10 \xt Matt. 26:26; Mark 14:22; Luke 22:19; 1 Cor. 11:24; [ver. 5] \x*the body of Jesus Christ \x + \xo 10:10 \xt ch. 7:27; 9:12\x*once for all.
\p
\v 11 And every priest stands \x + \xo 10:11 \xt [Num. 28:3] \x*daily at his service, \x + \xo 10:11 \xt See ch. 5:1 \x*offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, \x + \xo 10:11 \xt ver. 1, 4; [ch. 9:9]\x*which can never take away sins.
\v 12 But when Christ\f + \fr 10:12 \ft Greek \fq this one\f* had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he \x + \xo 10:12 \xt ch. 1:3; See Mark 16:19\x*sat down at the right hand of God,
\v 13 waiting from that time \x + \xo 10:13 \xt ch. 1:13; [1 Cor. 15:25-28]\x*until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet.
\v 14 For by a single offering \x + \xo 10:14 \xt ver. 1\x*he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
\p
\v 15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
\b
\q1
\v 16 \x + \xo 10:16 \xt ch. 8:10; Rom. 11:27; Cited from Jer. 31:33\x*“This is the covenant that I will make with them
\q2 after those days, declares the Lord:
\q1 I will put my laws on their hearts,
\q2 and write them on their minds,”
\b
\m
\v 17 then he adds,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 10:17 \xt ch. 8:12; Cited from Jer. 31:34\x*“I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.”
\b
\m
\v 18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
\s1 The Full Assurance of Faith
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 10:19 \xt See ch. 4:16 \x*Therefore, brothers,\f + \fr 10:19 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* since we have confidence to enter \x + \xo 10:19 \xt ch. 9:25\x*the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
\v 20 by \x + \xo 10:20 \xt ch. 9:8; [John 10:9; 14:6] \x*the new and living way that he opened for us through \x + \xo 10:20 \xt ch. 9:3\x*the curtain, that is, through his flesh,
\v 21 and since we have \x + \xo 10:21 \xt Zech. 6:11-13; [ch. 4:14]; See ch. 2:17\x*a great priest over the house of God,
\v 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts \x + \xo 10:22 \xt Ezek. 36:25; [ch. 12:24; 2 Cor. 7:1; 1 Pet. 1:2] \x*sprinkled clean \x + \xo 10:22 \xt ch. 9:14 \x*from an evil conscience and our bodies \x + \xo 10:22 \xt [1 Cor. 6:11]\x*washed with pure water.
\v 23 \x + \xo 10:23 \xt ch. 4:14 \x*Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for \x + \xo 10:23 \xt ch. 11:11; See 1 Cor. 1:9\x*he who promised is faithful.
\v 24 And \x + \xo 10:24 \xt [ch. 3:13]\x*let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,
\v 25 \x + \xo 10:25 \xt [Acts 2:42] \x*not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and \x + \xo 10:25 \xt Rom. 13:11-13 \x*all the more as you see \x + \xo 10:25 \xt See 1 Cor. 3:13\x*the Day drawing near.
\p
\v 26 For \x + \xo 10:26 \xt Num. 15:30; Deut. 17:12 \x*if we go on sinning deliberately \x + \xo 10:26 \xt ch. 6:4; 2 Pet. 2:20, 21 \x*after receiving the knowledge of the truth, \x + \xo 10:26 \xt [ch. 6:6; 1 John 5:16]\x*there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
\v 27 \x + \xo 10:27 \xt ch. 2:3; 12:25 \x*but a fearful expectation of judgment, and \x + \xo 10:27 \xt Ps. 79:5; Isa. 26:11; Zeph. 1:18; 3:8; [Ezek. 36:5; Zech. 8:2]; See 2 Thess. 1:8\x*a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
\v 28 \x + \xo 10:28 \xt Deut. 17:2-6 \x*Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy \x + \xo 10:28 \xt See Num. 35:30\x*on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
\v 29 How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one \x + \xo 10:29 \xt [ch. 6:6] \x*who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned \x + \xo 10:29 \xt ch. 13:20; Zech. 9:11 \x*the blood of the covenant \x + \xo 10:29 \xt ch. 9:13, 14 \x*by which he was sanctified, and has \x + \xo 10:29 \xt [Matt. 12:31, 32; Eph. 4:30]\x*outraged the Spirit of grace?
\v 30 For we know him who said, \x + \xo 10:30 \xt Rom. 12:19; Cited from Deut. 32:35 \x*“Vengeance is mine; I will repay.” And again, \x + \xo 10:30 \xt Ps. 50:4; 135:14; Cited from Deut. 32:36\x*“The Lord will judge his people.”
\v 31 \x + \xo 10:31 \xt Isa. 33:14; Luke 12:5\x*It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
\p
\v 32 But recall the former days when, after \x + \xo 10:32 \xt ch. 6:4 \x*you were enlightened, you endured \x + \xo 10:32 \xt See Phil. 1:30\x*a hard struggle with sufferings,
\v 33 sometimes being \x + \xo 10:33 \xt 1 Cor. 4:9 (Gk.)\x*publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
\v 34 For \x + \xo 10:34 \xt [ch. 13:3; Matt. 25:36; 2 Tim. 1:16] \x*you had compassion on those in prison, and \x + \xo 10:34 \xt See Matt. 5:12 \x*you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had \x + \xo 10:34 \xt 1 Pet. 1:4\x*a better possession and an abiding one.
\v 35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has \x + \xo 10:35 \xt ch. 2:2; 11:26\x*a great reward.
\v 36 For \x + \xo 10:36 \xt ch. 12:1-7; Luke 21:19; Rom. 2:7; 12:12; See Matt. 10:22 \x*you have need of endurance, so that \x + \xo 10:36 \xt ch. 13:21; [1 John 2:17] \x*when you have done the will of God you may \x + \xo 10:36 \xt ch. 11:39\x*receive what is promised.
\v 37 For,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 10:37 \xt Isa. 26:20; Hag. 2:6; Luke 18:8 \x*“Yet a little while,
\q2 and \x + \xo 10:37 \xt Cited from Hab. 2:3, 4\x*the coming one will come and will not delay;
\q1
\v 38 \x + \xo 10:38 \xt Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11\x*but my righteous one shall live by faith,
\q2 and if he shrinks back,
\q1 my soul has no pleasure in him.”
\b
\m
\v 39 But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.
\c 11
\s1 By Faith
\p \v 1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of \x + \xo 11:1 \xt Rom. 8:24; 2 Cor. 4:18; 5:7; 1 Pet. 1:8\x*things not seen.
\v 2 For by it the people of old received their commendation.
\v 3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by \x + \xo 11:3 \xt See Gen. 1:1 \x*the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of \x + \xo 11:3 \xt [Rom. 4:17]\x*things that are visible.
\p
\v 4 By faith \x + \xo 11:4 \xt Gen. 4:4-8; 1 John 3:12 \x*Abel offered to God \x + \xo 11:4 \xt Prov. 15:8 \x*a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And \x + \xo 11:4 \xt Gen. 4:10 \x*through his faith, though he died, he \x + \xo 11:4 \xt ch. 12:24\x*still speaks.
\v 5 By faith \x + \xo 11:5 \xt Gen. 5:22-24; [2 Kgs. 2:11]\x*Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.
\v 6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God \x + \xo 11:6 \xt 1 Chr. 28:9; Jer. 29:12-14; [John 4:24]\x*must believe that he exists and \x + \xo 11:6 \xt 1 Chr. 28:9; Jer. 29:12-14; [John 4:24]\x*that he rewards those who seek him.
\v 7 By faith \x + \xo 11:7 \xt Gen. 6:13-22; Luke 17:26; 1 Pet. 3:20 \x*Noah, being warned by God concerning \x + \xo 11:7 \xt ver. 1 \x*events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of \x + \xo 11:7 \xt Rom. 4:13; [Gen. 6:9; Ezek. 14:14, 20]\x*the righteousness that comes by faith.
\p
\v 8 By faith \x + \xo 11:8 \xt Gen. 12:1-4; Acts 7:2-4 \x*Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place \x + \xo 11:8 \xt Gen. 12:7\x*that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
\v 9 By faith he went to live in \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Acts 7:5 \x*the land of promise, as in a foreign land, \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Gen. 12:8; 13:3, 18; 18:1, 9 \x*living in tents \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Gen. 35:27\x*with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.
\v 10 For he was looking forward to \x + \xo 11:10 \xt ch. 12:22; [ch. 13:14] \x*the city that has \x + \xo 11:10 \xt Ps. 87:1; Rev. 21:14 \x*foundations, \x + \xo 11:10 \xt Rev. 21:2, 10\x*whose designer and builder is God.
\v 11 By faith \x + \xo 11:11 \xt Gen. 17:19; 18:11-14; 21:2 \x*Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered \x + \xo 11:11 \xt ch. 10:23\x*him faithful who had promised.
\v 12 Therefore from one man, and \x + \xo 11:12 \xt Rom. 4:19 \x*him as good as dead, were born descendants \x + \xo 11:12 \xt Gen. 22:17; 32:12; See Gen. 15:5\x*as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.
\p
\v 13 These all died in faith, \x + \xo 11:13 \xt ver. 39 \x*not having received the things promised, but \x + \xo 11:13 \xt ver. 27; John 8:56; [Matt. 13:17] \x*having seen them and greeted them from afar, and \x + \xo 11:13 \xt Gen. 23:4; 47:9; [1 Chr. 29:15; Ps. 39:12] \x*having acknowledged that they were \x + \xo 11:13 \xt Eph. 2:19\x*strangers and exiles on the earth.
\v 14 For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
\v 15 If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, \x + \xo 11:15 \xt [Gen. 24:6-8]\x*they would have had opportunity to return.
\v 16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed \x + \xo 11:16 \xt Gen. 26:24; 28:13; Ex. 3:6; 4:5; [ch. 2:11] \x*to be called their God, for \x + \xo 11:16 \xt [ver. 10; Matt. 25:34; John 14:2]\x*he has prepared for them a city.
\p
\v 17 By faith \x + \xo 11:17 \xt Gen. 22:1-10; James 2:21\x*Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son,
\v 18 of whom it was said, \x + \xo 11:18 \xt Rom. 9:7; Cited from Gen. 21:12\x*“Through Isaac shall your offspring be named.”
\v 19 \x + \xo 11:19 \xt Rom. 4:17-21\x*He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
\v 20 By faith \x + \xo 11:20 \xt Gen. 27:27-29, 39, 40\x*Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.
\v 21 By faith \x + \xo 11:21 \xt Gen. 48:16, 20 \x*Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, \x + \xo 11:21 \xt [Gen. 47:31]\x*bowing in worship over the head of his staff.
\v 22 By faith \x + \xo 11:22 \xt Gen. 50:24, 25; Ex. 13:19\x*Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.
\p
\v 23 By faith \x + \xo 11:23 \xt Ex. 2:2, 3; Acts 7:20 \x*Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of \x + \xo 11:23 \xt Ex. 1:16, 22\x*the king’s edict.
\v 24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, \x + \xo 11:24 \xt Ex. 2:10, 11\x*refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
\v 25 \x + \xo 11:25 \xt [Job 36:21; Ps. 84:10] \x*choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy \x + \xo 11:25 \xt 1 John 2:17\x*the fleeting pleasures of sin.
\v 26 \x + \xo 11:26 \xt ch. 13:13; [Ps. 89:50, 51; Phil. 3:7, 8; 1 Pet. 4:14] \x*He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to \x + \xo 11:26 \xt ch. 2:2; 10:35\x*the reward.
\v 27 By faith he \x + \xo 11:27 \xt Ex. 12:37; 13:17, 18 \x*left Egypt, \x + \xo 11:27 \xt Ex. 10:28, 29 \x*not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured \x + \xo 11:27 \xt ver. 13; See 1 Tim. 1:17\x*as seeing him who is invisible.
\v 28 By faith \x + \xo 11:28 \xt Ex. 12:21-30\x*he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.
\p
\v 29 By faith \x + \xo 11:29 \xt Ex. 14:21-30\x*the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned.
\v 30 By faith \x + \xo 11:30 \xt Josh. 6:15, 16, 20\x*the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
\v 31 By faith \x + \xo 11:31 \xt Josh. 6:25; James 2:25 \x*Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she \x + \xo 11:31 \xt Josh. 2:1, 8-13\x*had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
\p
\v 32 And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of \x + \xo 11:32 \xt Judg. 6:11 \x*Gideon, \x + \xo 11:32 \xt Judg. 4:6 \x*Barak, \x + \xo 11:32 \xt Judg. 13:24 \x*Samson, \x + \xo 11:32 \xt Judg. 11:1 \x*Jephthah, of \x + \xo 11:32 \xt 1 Sam. 16:1, 13 \x*David and \x + \xo 11:32 \xt 1 Sam. 1:20\x*Samuel and the prophets—
\v 33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, \x + \xo 11:33 \xt Judg. 14:6; 1 Sam. 17:35; Dan. 6:22\x*stopped the mouths of lions,

\v 35 \x + \xo 11:35 \xt 1 Kgs. 17:22; 2 Kgs. 4:35\x*Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life.
\v 36 Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even \x + \xo 11:36 \xt Gen. 39:20; Jer. 20:2; 37:15\x*chains and imprisonment.
\v 37 \x + \xo 11:37 \xt 1 Kgs. 21:13; 2 Chr. 24:21 \x*They were stoned, they were sawn in two,\f + \fr 11:37 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq they were tempted\f* \x + \xo 11:37 \xt 1 Kgs. 19:10; Jer. 26:23 \x*they were killed with the sword. \x + \xo 11:37 \xt 2 Kgs. 1:8\x*They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated—
\v 38 of whom the world was not worthy—\x + \xo 11:38 \xt 1 Sam. 22:1; 1 Kgs. 18:4; 19:9\x*wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

\v 40 since God had provided something better for us, \x + \xo 11:40 \xt [Rev. 6:11]\x*that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
\c 12
\s1 Jesus, Founder and Perfecter of Our Faith
\p \v 1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and \x + \xo 12:1 \xt See Eph. 4:22 \x*sin which clings so closely, and \x + \xo 12:1 \xt See 1 Cor. 9:24 \x*let us run \x + \xo 12:1 \xt See ch. 10:36 \x*with endurance the race that is \x + \xo 12:1 \xt ch. 6:18\x*set before us,
\v 2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Luke 24:26; Phil. 2:8; [Isa. 53:11] \x*who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Ps. 22:6, 7; 69:19; Isa. 53:3 \x*the shame, and \x + \xo 12:2 \xt ch. 1:3\x*is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
\s1 Do Not Grow Weary
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3 \xt [Matt. 10:24; Rev. 2:3] \x*Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or \x + \xo 12:3 \xt Gal. 6:9\x*fainthearted.
\v 4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
\v 5 And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 12:5 \xt Cited from Prov. 3:11, 12 \x*“My son, \x + \xo 12:5 \xt Job 5:17\x*do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
\q2 nor be weary when reproved by him.
\q1
\v 6 For \x + \xo 12:6 \xt Ps. 94:12; 119:67, 75; Rev. 3:19\x*the Lord disciplines the one he loves,
\q2 and chastises every son whom he receives.”
\b
\m
\v 7 It is for discipline that you have to endure. \x + \xo 12:7 \xt Deut. 8:5; 2 Sam. 7:14; [Prov. 13:24; 19:18; 23:13]\x*God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
\v 8 If you are left without discipline, \x + \xo 12:8 \xt [1 Pet. 5:9]\x*in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
\v 9 Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to \x + \xo 12:9 \xt See Num. 16:22 \x*the Father of spirits \x + \xo 12:9 \xt [Isa. 38:16]\x*and live?
\v 10 For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, \x + \xo 12:10 \xt [2 Pet. 1:4]; See Lev. 11:44\x*that we may share his holiness.
\v 11 \x + \xo 12:11 \xt [1 Pet. 1:6] \x*For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields \x + \xo 12:11 \xt James 3:17, 18\x*the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
\p
\v 12 Therefore \x + \xo 12:12 \xt Cited from Isa. 35:3; [Job 4:3, 4]\x*lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,
\v 13 and \x + \xo 12:13 \xt Prov. 4:26, 27 \x*make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint \x + \xo 12:13 \xt James 5:16; [Gal. 6:1]\x*but rather be healed.
\v 14 \x + \xo 12:14 \xt See Rom. 14:19 \x*Strive for peace with everyone, and for the \x + \xo 12:14 \xt 1 Thess. 4:7 \x*holiness \x + \xo 12:14 \xt Matt. 5:8; [2 Cor. 7:1; Eph. 5:5; Rev. 21:27; 22:4]\x*without which no one will see the Lord.
\v 15 See to it that no one \x + \xo 12:15 \xt ch. 4:1; [2 Cor. 6:1; Gal. 5:4] \x*fails to obtain the grace of God; that no \x + \xo 12:15 \xt Deut. 29:18\x*“root of bitterness” springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;
\v 16 that no one is \x + \xo 12:16 \xt ch. 13:4; Gen. 25:33\x*sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
\v 17 For you know that \x + \xo 12:17 \xt Gen. 27:34, 36, 38\x*afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.
\s1 A Kingdom That Cannot Be Shaken
\p
\v 18 For you have not come to \x + \xo 12:18 \xt Ex. 19:18; 20:18; Deut. 4:11; 5:22; [2 Cor. 3:9]\x*what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
\v 19 and \x + \xo 12:19 \xt Ex. 19:16, 19 \x*the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words \x + \xo 12:19 \xt Ex. 20:19; Deut. 5:5; 18:16\x*made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them.
\v 20 For they could not endure the order that was given, \x + \xo 12:20 \xt Cited from Ex. 19:12, 13\x*“If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.”
\v 21 Indeed, \x + \xo 12:21 \xt [Ex. 19:16; Deut. 9:19]\x*so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I tremble with fear.”
\v 22 But you have come to \x + \xo 12:22 \xt Rev. 14:1 \x*Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, \x + \xo 12:22 \xt See Gal. 4:26 \x*the heavenly Jerusalem, and to \x + \xo 12:22 \xt Jude 14\x*innumerable angels in festal gathering,
\v 23 and to \x + \xo 12:23 \xt [Ex. 4:22] \x*the assembly\f + \fr 12:23 \ft Or \fq church\f* of the firstborn who are \x + \xo 12:23 \xt Luke 10:20 \x*enrolled in heaven, and to \x + \xo 12:23 \xt Gen. 18:25\x*God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
\v 24 and to Jesus, \x + \xo 12:24 \xt ch. 8:6; 9:15 \x*the mediator of a new covenant, and to \x + \xo 12:24 \xt See ch. 10:22 \x*the sprinkled blood \x + \xo 12:24 \xt ch. 11:4; Gen. 4:10\x*that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
\p
\v 25 See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For \x + \xo 12:25 \xt See ch. 2:3\x*if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven.
\v 26 At that time \x + \xo 12:26 \xt Ex. 19:18 \x*his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, \x + \xo 12:26 \xt Cited from Hag. 2:6; [Hag. 2:21]\x*“Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.”
\v 27 This phrase, “Yet once more,” indicates \x + \xo 12:27 \xt See Ps. 102:26\x*the removal of things that are shaken—that is, things that have been made—in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain.
\v 28 Therefore let us be grateful for receiving \x + \xo 12:28 \xt Dan. 2:44 \x*a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus \x + \xo 12:28 \xt ch. 13:15\x*let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe,
\v 29 for our \x + \xo 12:29 \xt Cited from Deut. 4:24; See 2 Thess. 1:8\x*God is a consuming fire.
\c 13
\s1 Sacrifices Pleasing to God
\p \v 1 Let \x + \xo 13:1 \xt Rom. 12:10; 1 Thess. 4:9; 1 Pet. 1:22; 2 Pet. 1:7; [1 Pet. 2:17; 3:8; 1 John 3:10; 4:7, 20, 21]\x*brotherly love continue.
\v 2 \x + \xo 13:2 \xt See Matt. 25:35; 1 Pet. 4:9 \x*Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby \x + \xo 13:2 \xt Gen. 18:3; 19:2\x*some have entertained angels unawares.
\v 3 \x + \xo 13:3 \xt ch. 10:34; Matt. 25:36\x*Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.
\v 4 \x + \xo 13:4 \xt 1 Cor. 7:38; [1 Tim. 4:3] \x*Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge \x + \xo 13:4 \xt See 1 Cor. 6:9\x*the sexually immoral and adulterous.
\v 5 Keep your life \x + \xo 13:5 \xt 1 Tim. 3:3 \x*free from love of money, and \x + \xo 13:5 \xt 1 Tim. 6:7, 8; [Phil. 4:11]; See Matt. 6:25 \x*be content with what you have, for he has said, \x + \xo 13:5 \xt Cited from Josh. 1:5; [Ps. 37:25; 2 Cor. 4:9]\x*“I will never leave you nor forsake you.”
\v 6 So we can confidently say,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 13:6 \xt Cited from Ps. 118:6; [Ps. 27:1] \x*“The Lord is my helper;
\q2 \x + \xo 13:6 \xt Ps. 56:4, 11\x*I will not fear;
\q1 what can man do to me?”
\b
\p
\v 7 Remember \x + \xo 13:7 \xt ver. 17, 24 \x*your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and \x + \xo 13:7 \xt [ch. 6:12]\x*imitate their faith.
\v 8 Jesus Christ is \x + \xo 13:8 \xt ch. 1:12; John 8:58; Rev. 1:4, 8; [2 Cor. 1:19]\x*the same yesterday and today and forever.
\v 9 Do not be \x + \xo 13:9 \xt Jude 12; See Eph. 4:14 \x*led away by diverse and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, \x + \xo 13:9 \xt See Col. 2:16\x*not by foods, which have not benefited those devoted to them.
\v 10 We have an altar \x + \xo 13:10 \xt [1 Cor. 9:13; 10:18]\x*from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.
\v 11 For \x + \xo 13:11 \xt See Ex. 29:14 \x*the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned \x + \xo 13:11 \xt ver. 13\x*outside the camp.
\v 12 So Jesus also \x + \xo 13:12 \xt ch. 9:12 \x*suffered \x + \xo 13:12 \xt Matt. 21:39; 27:32; John 19:17, 20; [Acts 7:58] \x*outside the gate in order to sanctify the people \x + \xo 13:12 \xt [Rev. 14:20]\x*through his own blood.
\v 13 Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear \x + \xo 13:13 \xt ch. 11:26; 1 Pet. 4:14\x*the reproach he endured.
\v 14 For \x + \xo 13:14 \xt [ch. 11:10, 16; 12:28; Mic. 2:10]; See Eph. 2:19\x*here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come.
\v 15 \x + \xo 13:15 \xt Eph. 5:20 \x*Through him then let us continually offer up \x + \xo 13:15 \xt Lev. 7:12; Ps. 107:22; 116:17 \x*a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, \x + \xo 13:15 \xt Isa. 57:19; Hos. 14:2; [Ps. 119:108]\x*the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.
\v 16 Do not neglect to do good and \x + \xo 13:16 \xt See Rom. 12:13 \x*to share what you have, for such \x + \xo 13:16 \xt Mic. 6:7, 8; Phil. 4:18\x*sacrifices are pleasing to God.
\p
\v 17 Obey \x + \xo 13:17 \xt ver. 7, 24 \x*your leaders and submit to them, \x + \xo 13:17 \xt See Ezek. 3:17 \x*for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to \x + \xo 13:17 \xt Jer. 13:20; Ezek. 34:10 \x*give an account. \x + \xo 13:17 \xt [Acts 20:24, 31]\x*Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 13:18 \xt 1 Thess. 5:25; 2 Thess. 3:1\x*Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.
\v 19 I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order \x + \xo 13:19 \xt [Philem. 22]\x*that I may be restored to you the sooner.
\s1 Benediction
\p
\v 20 Now \x + \xo 13:20 \xt See Rom. 15:33 \x*may the God of peace \x + \xo 13:20 \xt See Acts 2:24 \x*who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, \x + \xo 13:20 \xt Isa. 63:11; See John 10:11 \x*the great shepherd of the sheep, by \x + \xo 13:20 \xt ch. 10:29; Zech. 9:11; [Isa. 54:10]\x*the blood of the eternal covenant,
\v 21 \x + \xo 13:21 \xt 2 Thess. 2:17; 1 Pet. 5:10 \x*equip you with everything good that you may do his will, \x + \xo 13:21 \xt ch. 10:36; [Phil. 2:13] \x*working in us\f + \fr 13:21 \ft Some manuscripts \fq you\f* that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, \x + \xo 13:21 \xt See Rom. 11:36\x*to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
\s1 Final Greetings
\p
\v 22 I appeal to you, brothers,\f + \fr 13:22 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* bear with my word of exhortation, for \x + \xo 13:22 \xt [1 Pet. 5:12]\x*I have written to you briefly.
\v 23 You should know that \x + \xo 13:23 \xt See 1 Thess. 3:2\x*our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes soon.
\v 24 Greet all \x + \xo 13:24 \xt ver. 7, 17\x*your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.
\v 25 \x + \xo 13:25 \xt See Col. 4:18\x*Grace be with all of you.
