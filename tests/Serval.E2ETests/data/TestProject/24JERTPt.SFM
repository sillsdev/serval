\p \v 1 The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Ezek. 1:3 \x*of the priests who were in \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ch. 29:27; 32:7; Josh. 21:18\x*Anathoth in the land of Benjamin,
\v 2 to whom the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came in the days of \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See 2 Kgs. 22; 23:1-30 \x*Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 25:3; 36:2\x*the thirteenth year of his reign.
\v 3 It came also in the days of \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ch. 25:1; 36:1; See 2 Kgs. 23:34–24:6 \x*Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ch. 39:2 \x*until the end of the eleventh year of \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See 2 Kgs. 24:17–25:7 \x*Zedekiah, the son of Josiah, king of Judah, \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See 2 Kgs. 25:8-11\x*until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
\s1 The Call of Jeremiah
\p
\v 4 Now the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me, saying,
\b
\q1
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt See Isa. 44:2 \x*“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,
\q1 and before you were born \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [John 10:36] \x*I consecrated you;
\q1 I appointed you a prophet \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [Isa. 49:6]; See ch. 25:15-29; ch. 46–51\x*to the nations.”
\b
\m
\v 6 Then I said, “Ah, Lord \nd God\nd*! Behold, \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Ex. 4:10] \x*I do not know how to speak, \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [1 Kgs. 3:7]\x*for I am only a youth.”
\v 7 But the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
\b
\q1 “Do not say, ‘I am only a youth’;
\q1 for to all to whom I send you, you shall go,
\q1 and \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ver. 17; Ezek. 2:7\x*whatever I command you, you shall speak.
\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Ezek. 2:6; 3:9 \x*Do not be afraid of them,
\q1 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ch. 15:20; See Ex. 3:12\x*for I am with you to deliver you,
\qr declares the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\b
\m
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [Ezek. 2:9] \x*Then the \nd Lord\nd* put out his hand and \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [Isa. 6:7] \x*touched my mouth. And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me,
\b
\q1 “Behold, I have put \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ch. 5:14\x*my words in your mouth.
\q1
\v 10 See, I have set you this day \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [See ver. 5 above] \x*over nations and over kingdoms,
\q1 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 18:7; 31:28; 45:4; [2 Cor. 10:4, 5]\x*to pluck up and to break down,
\q1 to destroy and to overthrow,
\q1 to build and to plant.”
\b
\p
\v 11 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me, saying, \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [Amos 7:8]\x*“Jeremiah, what do you see?” And I said, “I see an almond\f + \fr 1:11 \fq Almond \ft sounds like the Hebrew for \fq watching \ft (compare verse 12)\f* branch.”
\v 12 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, “You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it.”
\p
\v 13 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me a second time, saying, “What do you see?” And I said, “I see \x + \xo 1:13 \xt Ezek. 24:3; [Ezek. 22:21] \x*a boiling pot, facing away \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 4:6; 6:1; 10:22\x*from the north.”
\v 14 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [See ver. 13 above]\x*“Out of the north disaster\f + \fr 1:14 \ft The Hebrew word can mean \fq evil\ft , \fq harm\ft , or \fq disaster\ft , depending on the context; so throughout Jeremiah\f* shall be let loose upon all the inhabitants of the land.
\v 15 For behold, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [ch. 25:9] \x*I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [ch. 39:3; 43:10]\x*and they shall come, and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls all around and against all the cities of Judah.
\v 16 And \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 4:12 \x*I will declare my judgments against them, for all their evil \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 19:4; 22:9 \x*in forsaking me. \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 7:9; 44:3 \x*They have made offerings to other gods and \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 25:6, 7; Isa. 2:8; Acts 7:41\x*worshiped the works of their own hands.
\v 17 But you, \x + \xo 1:17 \xt [1 Kgs. 18:46; 1 Pet. 1:13] \x*dress yourself for work;\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Hebrew \fq gird up your loins\f* arise, and \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ver. 7 \x*say to them everything that I command you. \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ver. 8; Ezek. 3:9\x*Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.
\v 18 And I, behold, I make you this day \x + \xo 1:18 \xt [Isa. 50:7] \x*a fortified city, \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Rev. 3:12 \x*an iron pillar, and \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ch. 15:20; [ch. 6:27]\x*bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its officials, its priests, and the people of the land.
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19 \xt [See ver. 18 above] \x*They will fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you, for \x + \xo 1:19 \xt ver. 8; [Acts 18:9, 10]\x*I am with you, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, to deliver you.”

\s1 Israel Forsakes the \nd Lord\nd*
\p \v 1 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me, saying,
\v 2 “Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*,
\b
\q1 “I remember the devotion of \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 3:4 \x*your youth,

\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Ex. 28:36; [Ex. 19:5, 6] \x*Israel was holy to the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt James 1:18; [Ex. 4:22] \x*the firstfruits of his harvest.
\q1 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 12:14; Ezek. 25:12, 13; [Gen. 12:3]\x*All who ate of it incurred guilt;
\q2 disaster came upon them,
\qr declares the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\b
\p
\v 4 Hear the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, O house of Jacob, and all the clans of the house of Israel.
\v 5 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*:
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ver. 31; Isa. 5:4; Mic. 6:3 \x*“What wrong did your fathers find in me
\q2 that they went far from me,
\q1 \x + \xo 2:5 \xt 2 Kgs. 17:15 \x*and went after \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ch. 10:15; 14:22; 16:19\x*worthlessness, and became worthless?
\q1
\v 6 They did not say, \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Isa. 63:11-13; Hos. 13:4, 5] \x*‘Where is the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 who brought us up from the land of Egypt,
\q1 who led us \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Deut. 8:15; 32:10\x*in the wilderness,
\q2 in a land of deserts and pits,
\q1 in a land of drought and deep darkness,
\q2 in a land that none passes through,
\q2 where no man dwells?’
\q1
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt See Deut. 8:7-10 \x*And I brought you into a plentiful land
\q2 to enjoy its fruits and its good things.
\q1 But when you came in, \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Ps. 106:38; [Lev. 18:24, 25]\x*you defiled my land
\q2 and made my heritage an abomination.
\q1
\v 8 The priests did not say, ‘Where is the \nd Lord\nd*?’
\q2 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt ch. 18:18; [Mal. 2:7; Rom. 2:20] \x*Those who handle the law did not know me;
\q1 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [ch. 5:5] \x*the shepherds\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or \fq rulers\f* transgressed against me;
\q2 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt ch. 23:13; [ch. 5:31] \x*the prophets prophesied by Baal
\q2 and went after \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [Hab. 2:18]\x*things that do not profit.
\b
\q1
\v 9 “Therefore \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ver. 35; Ezek. 17:20; 20:35, 36 \x*I still contend with you,
\qr declares the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q2 and \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Ex. 20:5, 6\x*with your children’s children I will contend.
\q1
\v 10 For cross to the coasts of \x + \xo 2:10 \xt See Gen. 10:4 \x*Cyprus and see,
\q2 or send to \x + \xo 2:10 \xt See Isa. 21:16\x*Kedar and examine with care;
\q2 see if there has been such a thing.
\q1
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [Mic. 4:5]; See ch. 18:13-15 \x*Has a nation changed its gods,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 16:20; Isa. 37:19; Gal. 4:8 \x*even though they are no gods?
\q1 But my people \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Ps. 106:20 \x*have changed their glory
\q2 for \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [See ver. 8 above]\x*that which does not profit.
\q1
\v 12 Be appalled, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Isa. 1:2\x*O heavens, at this;
\q2 be shocked, be utterly desolate,
\qr declares the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1
\v 13 for my people have committed two evils:
\q1 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ch. 17:13 \x*they have forsaken \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Ps. 36:9 \x*me,
\q2 the fountain of \x + \xo 2:13 \xt John 4:10\x*living waters,
\q1 and hewed out cisterns for themselves,
\q2 broken cisterns that can hold no water.
\b
\q1
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Ex. 4:22]\x*“Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant?
\q2 Why then has he become a prey?
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ch. 4:7; Isa. 5:29 \x*The lions have roared against him;
\q2 they have roared loudly.
\q1 They have made his land a waste;
\q2 his cities are in ruins, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ch. 9:11; 46:19\x*without inhabitant.
\q1
\v 16 Moreover, the men of \x + \xo 2:16 \xt ch. 44:1; 46:14; Ezek. 30:16 \x*Memphis and \x + \xo 2:16 \xt ch. 43:7-9 \x*Tahpanhes

\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ver. 36; Isa. 30:1, 2; 31:1 \x*And now what do you gain by going to Egypt
\q2 to drink the waters of \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Isa. 23:3 \x*the Nile?
\q1 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [Hos. 7:11] \x*Or what do you gain by going to Assyria

\b
\q1
\v 20 “For long ago I \x + \xo 2:20 \xt ch. 5:5; 30:8 \x*broke your yoke

\q1
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23 \xt ver. 35 \x*How can you say, ‘I am not unclean,
\q2 I have not gone after the Baals’?
\q1 Look at your way \x + \xo 2:23 \xt ch. 7:31, 32; 19:2, 6\x*in the valley;
\q2 know what you have done—
\q1 a restless young camel running here and there,

\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24 \xt ch. 14:6\x*a wild donkey used to the wilderness,
\q1 in her heat sniffing the wind!
\q2 Who can restrain her lust?

\q2 and after them I will go.’
\b
\q1
\v 26 “As a thief is shamed when caught,
\q2 so the house of Israel shall be shamed:

\s1 Faithless Israel Called to Repentance
\p
\v 6 The \nd Lord\nd* said to me in the days of \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ch. 1:2 \x*King Josiah: “Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See ch. 2:20 \x*how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*played the whore?
\v 7 And I thought, ‘After she has done all this she will return to me,’ but she did not return, and her treacherous \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [Ezek. 16:46; 23:4]\x*sister Judah saw it.

\s1 The Broken Covenant
\p \v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd*:
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2 \xt ver. 6, 8; [2 Kgs. 23:3]\x*“Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 3 You shall say to them, Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel: \x + \xo 11:3 \xt Deut. 27:26; Gal. 3:10\x*Cursed be the man who does not hear the words of this covenant
\v 4 that I commanded your fathers when I brought them out of the land of Egypt, \x + \xo 11:4 \xt Deut. 4:20 \x*from the iron furnace, saying, \x + \xo 11:4 \xt ch. 7:22, 23; Lev. 26:3, 12\x*Listen to my voice, and do all that I command you. \x + \xo 11:4 \xt ch. 7:22, 23; Lev. 26:3, 12\x*So shall you be my people, and I will be your God,
\v 5 \x + \xo 11:5 \xt Deut. 7:12, 13; Ps. 105:9, 10 \x*that I may confirm the oath that I swore to your fathers, \x + \xo 11:5 \xt See Ex. 3:8\x*to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as at this day.” Then I answered, “So be it, \nd Lord\nd*.”
\p
\v 6 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, \x + \xo 11:6 \xt [ch. 19:2] \x*“Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem: \x + \xo 11:6 \xt ver. 2, 8; [2 Kgs. 23:3]\x*Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
\v 7 For I solemnly warned your fathers when I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, \x + \xo 11:7 \xt ch. 7:25; See 2 Chr. 36:15 \x*warning them persistently, even to this day, saying, \x + \xo 11:7 \xt [See ver. 4 above]\x*Obey my voice.
\v 8 \x + \xo 11:8 \xt ch. 7:26; 32:23 \x*Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, \x + \xo 11:8 \xt See ch. 3:17 \x*but everyone walked in the stubbornness of his evil heart. Therefore I brought upon them all \x + \xo 11:8 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do, but they did not.”
\p
\v 9 Again the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Ezek. 22:25; [Isa. 8:12; Hos. 6:9]\x*“A conspiracy exists among the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 10 They have turned back to \x + \xo 11:10 \xt [ch. 17:23; Ps. 78:8; 79:8; Ezek. 20:18] \x*the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words. \x + \xo 11:10 \xt [ch. 17:23; Ps. 78:8; 79:8; Ezek. 20:18] \x*They have gone after other gods to serve them. \x + \xo 11:10 \xt Deut. 31:16, 20\x*The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant that I made with their fathers.
\v 11 Therefore, thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, Behold, I am bringing disaster upon them that they cannot escape. \x + \xo 11:11 \xt Prov. 1:28; Isa. 1:15; Ezek. 8:18; Mic. 3:4\x*Though they cry to me, I will not listen to them.
\v 12 Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem \x + \xo 11:12 \xt ch. 2:28; [Acts 17:16]\x*will go and cry to the gods to whom they make offerings, \x + \xo 11:12 \xt ch. 2:28; [Acts 17:16]\x*but they cannot save them in the time of their trouble.
\v 13 \x + \xo 11:13 \xt [See ver. 12 above] \x*For your gods have become as many as your cities, O Judah, and as many as the streets of Jerusalem are the altars you have set up to shame, \x + \xo 11:13 \xt [Hos. 9:10]; See Judg. 6:25-32\x*altars to make offerings to Baal.
\p
\v 14 “Therefore \x + \xo 11:14 \xt ch. 7:16; [Heb. 10:26; 1 John 5:16] \x*do not pray for this people, or lift up a cry or prayer on their behalf, \x + \xo 11:14 \xt [See ver. 11 above]\x*for I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
\v 15 \x + \xo 11:15 \xt Isa. 1:11, 12 \x*What right has my beloved in my house, \x + \xo 11:15 \xt [Ezek. 16:25] \x*when she has done many vile deeds? Can even sacrificial flesh avert your doom? \x + \xo 11:15 \xt Prov. 2:14\x*Can you then exult?
\v 16 The \nd Lord\nd* once called you \x + \xo 11:16 \xt Ps. 52:8; [Hos. 14:6] \x*‘a green olive tree, beautiful with good fruit.’ But \x + \xo 11:16 \xt [Ps. 83:2] \x*with the roar of a great tempest he will set fire to it, and \x + \xo 11:16 \xt Rom. 11:17, 20\x*its branches will be consumed.
\v 17 The \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, \x + \xo 11:17 \xt ch. 2:21; Isa. 5:2 \x*who planted you, has decreed disaster against you, because of the evil that the house of Israel and the house of Judah have done, \x + \xo 11:17 \xt See ch. 7:18\x*provoking me to anger by making offerings to Baal.”
\b
\q1
\v 18 The \nd Lord\nd* made it known to me and I knew;
\q2 then you showed me their deeds.
\q1
\v 19 But I was \x + \xo 11:19 \xt Isa. 53:7; [Rev. 5:6] \x*like a gentle lamb
\q2 led to the slaughter.
\q1 I did not know \x + \xo 11:19 \xt ch. 18:18; Lam. 3:60, 61 \x*it was against me
\q2 they devised schemes, saying,
\q1 “Let us destroy the tree with its fruit,
\q2 \x + \xo 11:19 \xt Ps. 83:4; Isa. 53:8 \x*let us cut him off from \x + \xo 11:19 \xt Ps. 27:13\x*the land of the living,
\q2 that his name be remembered no more.”
\q1
\v 20 But, O \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, who judges righteously,
\q2 who \x + \xo 11:20 \xt ch. 17:10; 20:12; Ps. 7:9; Rev. 2:23 \x*tests \x + \xo 11:20 \xt See 1 Sam. 16:7 \x*the heart and the mind,
\q1 \x + \xo 11:20 \xt ch. 15:15; 17:18; 20:12; Lam. 3:64\x*let me see your vengeance upon them,
\q2 for to you have I committed my cause.
\b
\p
\v 21 Therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd* concerning the men of \x + \xo 11:21 \xt Josh. 21:18 \x*Anathoth, \x + \xo 11:21 \xt [ch. 12:6; Matt. 13:57] \x*who seek your life, and say, \x + \xo 11:21 \xt Isa. 30:10\x*“Do not prophesy in the name of the \nd Lord\nd*, or you will die by our hand”—
\v 22 therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: “Behold, I will punish them. The young men shall die by the sword, their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,
\v 23 and none of them shall be left. For I will bring disaster upon the men of \x + \xo 11:23 \xt Josh. 21:18 \x*Anathoth, \x + \xo 11:23 \xt ch. 23:12\x*the year of their punishment.”

\q1
\v 2 You plant them, and they take root;
\q2 they grow and produce fruit;
\q1 \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Isa. 29:13\x*you are near in their mouth
\q2 and far from their heart.
\q1

\v 5 “If you have raced with men on foot, and they have wearied you,

\q1
\v 7 “I have forsaken my house;
\q2 I have abandoned \x + \xo 12:7 \xt Isa. 19:25 \x*my heritage;

\v 10 Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard;

\q1

\q1
\v 12 Upon all the bare heights in the desert

\c 13
\s1 The Ruined Loincloth
\p \v 1 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* to me, “Go and buy a linen loincloth and \x + \xo 13:1 \xt Ex. 28:39; Lev. 16:4; [Acts 21:11]\x*put it around your waist, and do not dip it in water.”
\v 2 So I bought a loincloth according to the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, and put it around my waist.
\v 3 And the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me a second time,
\v 4 “Take the loincloth that you have bought, which is around your waist, and arise, \x + \xo 13:4 \xt [ch. 51:59, 63] \x*go to the Euphrates and hide it there in \x + \xo 13:4 \xt Isa. 7:19\x*a cleft of the rock.”
\v 5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded me.
\v 6 And after many days the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, “Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take from there \x + \xo 13:6 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*the loincloth that I commanded you to hide there.”
\v 7 Then I went to the Euphrates, and dug, and I took \x + \xo 13:7 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*the loincloth from the place where I had hidden it. And behold, the loincloth was \x + \xo 13:7 \xt ch. 18:4 \x*spoiled; it was \x + \xo 13:7 \xt [Ezek. 15:4, 5]\x*good for nothing.
\p
\v 8 Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to me:
\v 9 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 13:9 \xt [Ps. 137:1] \x*Even so will I spoil the pride of Judah and the great \x + \xo 13:9 \xt Lev. 26:19\x*pride of Jerusalem.
\v 10 This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, \x + \xo 13:10 \xt [ch. 3:17; 16:11, 12] \x*who stubbornly follow their own heart and have gone after other gods to serve them and worship them, shall be like this loincloth, which is \x + \xo 13:10 \xt [See ver. 7 above]\x*good for nothing.
\v 11 For as the loincloth clings to the waist of a man, so I made the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah cling to me, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 13:11 \xt [Ex. 19:5] \x*that they might be for me a people, \x + \xo 13:11 \xt ch. 33:9; Isa. 55:13; Zeph. 3:20\x*a name, a praise, and a glory, but they would not listen.
\s1 The Jars Filled with Wine
\p
\v 12 “You shall speak to them this word: ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, “Every jar shall be filled with wine.”’ And they will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that \x + \xo 13:12 \xt ch. 48:12\x*every jar will be filled with wine?’
\v 13 Then you shall say to them, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 13:13 \xt Ezek. 23:33 \x*Behold, I will fill with drunkenness all the inhabitants of this land: \x + \xo 13:13 \xt ch. 17:20; 19:3; 22:2 \x*the kings who sit on David’s throne, \x + \xo 13:13 \xt [ch. 18:18]\x*the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

\q1
\v 2 \x + \xo 14:2 \xt Lam. 1:4 \x*“Judah mourns,
\q2 and \x + \xo 14:2 \xt Isa. 3:26; [Lam. 2:8] \x*her gates languish;

\q1
\v 3 Her nobles send their servants for water;

\q2 and \x + \xo 14:3 \xt [2 Sam. 15:30]\x*cover their heads.
\q1
\v 4 Because of the ground that is dismayed,
\q2 since there is \x + \xo 14:4 \xt ch. 3:3\x*no rain on the land,
\q1 the farmers are ashamed;
\q2 they cover their heads.
\q1
\v 5 Even \x + \xo 14:5 \xt Job 39:1; Ps. 29:9\x*the doe in the field forsakes her newborn fawn
\q2 because there is no grass.
\q1
\v 6 \x + \xo 14:6 \xt ch. 2:24\x*The wild donkeys stand on the bare heights;

\v 7 “Though our iniquities testify against us,

\b
\q1
\v 10 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* concerning this people:
\q1 “They have loved to wander thus;
\q2 they have not restrained their feet;
\q1 \x + \xo 14:10 \xt Hos. 8:13 \x*therefore the \nd Lord\nd* does not accept them;

\v 11 The \nd Lord\nd* said to me: \x + \xo 14:11 \xt See ch. 7:16\x*“Do not pray for the welfare of this people.
\v 12 Though they fast, I will not hear their cry, \x + \xo 14:12 \xt Prov. 1:28; Isa. 1:15; Ezek. 8:18; Mic. 3:4; See ch. 6:20 \x*and though they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them.

\s1 Lying Prophets
\p
\v 13 Then I said: “Ah, Lord \nd God\nd*, behold, the prophets \x + \xo 14:13 \xt [ch. 4:10; 6:14]\x*say to them, ‘You shall not see the sword, nor shall you have famine, but I will give you assured peace in this place.’”
\v 14 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to me: “The \x + \xo 14:14 \xt See ch. 5:31 \x*prophets are prophesying lies in my name. \x + \xo 14:14 \xt ch. 23:21; 27:15; Deut. 18:20; [Matt. 7:15; Mark 13:22] \x*I did not send them, nor did I command them or speak to them.

\v 15 Therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd* concerning the prophets who prophesy in my name although \x + \xo 14:15 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*I did not send them, and who say, \x + \xo 14:15 \xt [See ver. 12 above] \x*‘Sword and famine shall not come upon this land’: \x + \xo 14:15 \xt [ch. 23:34]\x*By sword and famine those prophets shall be consumed.

\s1 The \nd Lord\nd* Will Not Relent
\p \v 1 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said to me, \x + \xo 15:1 \xt Ps. 99:6; [Ezek. 14:14] \x*“Though \x + \xo 15:1 \xt [Ps. 106:23]; See Ex. 32:11-13 \x*Moses \x + \xo 15:1 \xt [1 Sam. 7:9; 8:6; 12:23; 15:11] \x*and Samuel \x + \xo 15:1 \xt ch. 35:19; [ver. 19]\x*stood before me, yet my heart would not turn toward this people.

\v 3 So I went down to \x + \xo 18:3 \xt ch. 19:1; 1 Chr. 4:23; [Zech. 11:13]\x*the potter’s house, and there he was working at his wheel.

\v 10 and if it does evil in my sight, not listening to my voice, then I will relent of the good that I had intended to do to it.
\v 11 Now, therefore, say to the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, Behold, I am shaping disaster against you and devising a plan against you. \x + \xo 18:11 \xt ch. 35:15; 2 Kgs. 17:13; Jonah 3:8 \x*Return, every one from his evil way, and \x + \xo 18:11 \xt ch. 7:3; 25:5; 35:15\x*amend your ways and your deeds.’

\p \v 1 Now \x + \xo 20:1 \xt ch. 21:1; 38:1; 1 Chr. 9:12; [Ezra 2:38] \x*Pashhur the priest, the son of \x + \xo 20:1 \xt 1 Chr. 24:14; Ezra 2:37 \x*Immer, who was \x + \xo 20:1 \xt [ch. 29:26]\x*chief officer in the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.
\v 2 Then \x + \xo 20:2 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*Pashhur beat Jeremiah the prophet, and put him \x + \xo 20:2 \xt ch. 29:26; Acts 16:24 \x*in the stocks that were in the upper \x + \xo 20:2 \xt ch. 37:13\x*Benjamin Gate of the house of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 3 The next day, when \x + \xo 20:3 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The \nd Lord\nd* does not call your name \x + \xo 20:3 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*Pashhur, but Terror on Every Side.
\v 4 For thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: Behold, I will make you \x + \xo 20:4 \xt See ch. 6:25\x*a terror to yourself and to all your friends. They shall fall by the sword of their enemies while you look on. And I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall strike them down with the sword.
\v 5 Moreover, \x + \xo 20:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 20:17]; See 2 Kgs. 24:12-16; 25:13-17 \x*I will give all the wealth of the city, all its gains, all its \x + \xo 20:5 \xt Job 28:10; Ezek. 22:25\x*prized belongings, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them and seize them and carry them to Babylon.
\v 6 And you, \x + \xo 20:6 \xt ch. 21:1; 38:1; 1 Chr. 9:12; [Ezra 2:38] \x*Pashhur, and all who dwell in your house, shall go into captivity. To Babylon you shall go, and there you shall die, and there you shall be buried, you and all your friends, \x + \xo 20:6 \xt See ch. 14:14\x*to whom you have prophesied falsely.”
\b
\q1
\v 7 O \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 20:7 \xt [Ezek. 14:9] \x*you have deceived me,
\q2 and I was deceived;
\q1 \x + \xo 20:7 \xt [2 Pet. 1:21] \x*you are stronger than I,
\q2 and you have prevailed.
\q1 \x + \xo 20:7 \xt Ps. 119:51; Lam. 3:14\x*I have become a laughingstock all the day;
\q2 everyone mocks me.
\q1
\v 8 For whenever I speak, I cry out,
\q2 I shout, \x + \xo 20:8 \xt ch. 6:7 \x*“Violence and destruction!”
\q1 For \x + \xo 20:8 \xt ch. 6:10 \x*the word of the \nd Lord\nd* has become for me
\q2 \x + \xo 20:8 \xt Ps. 44:13; 79:4\x*a reproach and \x + \xo 20:8 \xt Ps. 44:13; 79:4\x*derision all day long.
\q1
\v 9 If I say, “I will not mention him,
\q2 or speak any more in his name,”
\q1 \x + \xo 20:9 \xt Job 32:18, 19; Ps. 39:3 \x*there is in my heart as it were a burning fire
\q2 shut up in my bones,
\q1 and \x + \xo 20:9 \xt ch. 6:11\x*I am weary with holding it in,
\q2 and I cannot.
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 20:10 \xt Ps. 31:13 \x*For I hear many whispering.
\q2 \x + \xo 20:10 \xt See ch. 6:25 \x*Terror is on every side!
\q1 “Denounce him! \x + \xo 20:10 \xt [ch. 36:16, 20] \x*Let us denounce him!”
\q2 say all my \x + \xo 20:10 \xt Ps. 41:9; 55:13; [ch. 9:4; 38:22] \x*close friends,
\q2 \x + \xo 20:10 \xt [Ps. 56:6] \x*watching for \x + \xo 20:10 \xt Ps. 35:15 \x*my fall.
\q1 “Perhaps he will be deceived;
\q2 then \x + \xo 20:10 \xt ch. 1:19; 5:22\x*we can overcome him
\q2 and take our revenge on him.”
\q1
\v 11 But \x + \xo 20:11 \xt See ch. 1:8 \x*the \nd Lord\nd* is with me as a dread warrior;
\q2 therefore my persecutors will stumble;
\q2 \x + \xo 20:11 \xt See ch. 1:8 \x*they will not overcome me.
\q1 \x + \xo 20:11 \xt ch. 17:18; 23:40 \x*They will be greatly shamed,
\q2 for they will not succeed.
\q1 Their \x + \xo 20:11 \xt ch. 23:40\x*eternal dishonor
\q2 will never be forgotten.
\q1
\v 12 O \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, who tests the righteous,
\q2 \x + \xo 20:12 \xt See ch. 11:20\x*who sees the heart and the mind,\f + \fr 20:12 \ft Hebrew \fq kidneys\f*
\q1 let me see your vengeance upon them,
\q2 for to you have I committed my cause.
\b
\q1
\v 13 \x + \xo 20:13 \xt [Ps. 35:9, 10; 109:30, 31]\x*Sing to the \nd Lord\nd*;
\q2 praise the \nd Lord\nd*!
\q1 For he has delivered the life of the needy
\q2 from the hand of evildoers.
\b
\q1
\v 14 \x + \xo 20:14 \xt ch. 15:10; Job 3:3\x*Cursed be the day
\q2 on which I was born!
\q1 The day when my mother bore me,
\q2 let it not be blessed!
\q1
\v 15 Cursed be the man who brought the news to my father,
\q1 “A son is born to you,”
\q2 \x + \xo 20:15 \xt [John 16:21]\x*making him very glad.
\q1
\v 16 Let that man be like \x + \xo 20:16 \xt Gen. 19:25; Isa. 13:19 \x*the cities
\q2 that the \nd Lord\nd* overthrew without pity;
\q1 \x + \xo 20:16 \xt ch. 18:22\x*let him hear a cry in the morning
\q2 and an alarm at noon,
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 20:17 \xt [Job 3:10, 11]\x*because he did not kill me in the womb;
\q2 so my mother would have been my grave,
\q2 and her womb forever great.
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 20:18 \xt [Job 3:20] \x*Why did I come out from the womb
\q2 \x + \xo 20:18 \xt [Lam. 3:1, 2]\x*to see toil and sorrow,
\q2 and spend my days in shame?

\s1 Jerusalem Will Fall to Nebuchadnezzar
\p \v 1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd*, when King Zedekiah sent to him \x + \xo 21:1 \xt See ch. 20:1 \x*Pashhur the son of Malchiah and \x + \xo 21:1 \xt ch. 29:25; 37:3; 2 Kgs. 25:18 \x*Zephaniah the priest, the son of \x + \xo 21:1 \xt ch. 35:4; 2 Chr. 34:8\x*Maaseiah, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 21:2 \xt [ch. 37:7] \x*“Inquire of the \nd Lord\nd* for us, \x + \xo 21:2 \xt [2 Kgs. 25:1] \x*for Nebuchadnezzar\f + \fr 21:2 \ft Hebrew \fq Nebuchadrezzar\ft , an alternate spelling of \fq Nebuchadnezzar \ft (king of Babylon) occurring frequently from Jeremiah 21–52; this latter spelling is used throughout Jeremiah for consistency\f* king of Babylon is making war against us. Perhaps the \nd Lord\nd* will deal with us according to \x + \xo 21:2 \xt Ps. 105:2, 5\x*all his wonderful deeds and will make him withdraw from us.”
\p
\v 3 Then Jeremiah said to them: “Thus you shall say to Zedekiah,
\v 4 ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel: \x + \xo 21:4 \xt [ch. 32:5; 37:10] \x*Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting against the king of Babylon and against the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls. \x + \xo 21:4 \xt [Isa. 13:4]\x*And I will bring them together into the midst of this city.
\v 5 I myself will fight against you \x + \xo 21:5 \xt ch. 27:5; 32:17, 21; Ex. 6:6; Deut. 4:34; Ezek. 20:33 \x*with outstretched hand and strong arm, \x + \xo 21:5 \xt ch. 32:37; Deut. 29:28\x*in anger and in fury and in great wrath.
\v 6 And I will strike down the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast. They shall die of a great pestilence.
\v 7 Afterward, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 21:7 \xt ch. 37:17; 39:5; 52:9 \x*I will give Zedekiah king of Judah and his servants and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of their enemies, into the hand of those who seek their lives. He shall strike them down with the edge of the sword. \x + \xo 21:7 \xt Deut. 28:50; 2 Chr. 36:17; Ezek. 5:11\x*He shall not pity them or spare them or have compassion.’
\p
\v 8 “And to this people you shall say: \x + \xo 21:8 \xt Deut. 30:15, 19 \x*‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: Behold, \x + \xo 21:8 \xt ch. 38:2\x*I set before you the way of life and the way of death.

\v 10 For \x + \xo 21:10 \xt ch. 44:11; Lev. 20:3, 5; Ps. 34:16; Ezek. 14:8; [Amos 9:4] \x*I have set my face against this city for harm and \x + \xo 21:10 \xt [ch. 14:11] \x*not for good, declares the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 21:10 \xt ver. 7; ch. 34:2; 37:8, 10; 38:17, 18, 23; 39:8; 52:13; 2 Chr. 36:19\x*it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.’
\s1 Message to the House of David
\p
\v 11 “And to the house of the king of Judah say, ‘Hear the word of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\v 12 O house of David! Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*:

\q1 \x + \xo 21:12 \xt ch. 22:3; Zech. 7:9; [ch. 22:16] \x*“‘Execute justice \x + \xo 21:12 \xt Ps. 101:8 \x*in the morning,

\b
\q1
\v 13 \x + \xo 21:13 \xt [ver. 10]; See Ezek. 13:8 \x*“Behold, I am against you, O inhabitant of the valley,

\b
\c 22
\p \v 1 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: “Go down to the house of the king of Judah and speak there this word,

\s1 Message to the Sons of Josiah
\p
\v 11 For thus says the \nd Lord\nd* concerning Shallum the son of Josiah, king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, and \x + \xo 22:11 \xt [2 Kgs. 23:34; 2 Chr. 36:4; Ezek. 19:4]\x*who went away from this place: “He shall return here no more,

\v 15 Do you think you are a king

\q2 and because of his holy words.
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 23:10 \xt ch. 5:7, 8; 9:2 \x*For the land is full of adulterers;
\q2 \x + \xo 23:10 \xt Ps. 10:7; 59:12; Hos. 4:2, 3 \x*because of the curse \x + \xo 23:10 \xt ch. 4:28 \x*the land mourns,
\q2 and \x + \xo 23:10 \xt ch. 9:10; 12:4; Ps. 107:34 \x*the pastures of the wilderness are dried up.
\q1 \x + \xo 23:10 \xt [ch. 22:17]\x*Their course is evil,

\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 23:12 \xt Ps. 35:6; 73:18 \x*Therefore their way shall be to them

\q2 \x + \xo 23:13 \xt Lam. 2:14 \x*I saw an unsavory thing:

\q2 \x + \xo 23:13 \xt Isa. 9:16; Mic. 3:5\x*and led my people Israel astray.
\q1
\v 14 But in the prophets of Jerusalem
\q2 I have seen a horrible thing:

\q2 \x + \xo 23:14 \xt Ps. 64:5; Ezek. 13:22 \x*they strengthen the hands of evildoers,

\v 15 Therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts concerning the prophets:

\q2 ungodliness has gone out into all the land.”
\b

\v 16 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts: “Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you, \x + \xo 23:16 \xt [Ps. 12:2] \x*filling you with vain hopes. \x + \xo 23:16 \xt [ver. 21, 26; Num. 16:28]\x*They speak visions of their own minds, not from the mouth of the \nd Lord\nd*.

\s1 The Good Figs and the Bad Figs
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 24:1 \xt 2 Kgs. 24:12; 2 Chr. 36:10 \x*After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile from Jerusalem \x + \xo 24:1 \xt Matt. 1:11; [ch. 22:18, 24, 28] \x*Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, together with \x + \xo 24:1 \xt ch. 29:2; 2 Kgs. 24:12, 14 \x*the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the metal workers, and had brought them to Babylon, the \nd Lord\nd* showed me this vision: behold, \x + \xo 24:1 \xt Amos 8:1, 2\x*two baskets of figs placed before the temple of the \nd Lord\nd*.

\v 4 Give them this charge for their masters: ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel: This is what you shall say to your masters:

\v 12 To \x + \xo 27:12 \xt ch. 28:1; [ver. 1] \x*Zedekiah king of Judah I spoke in like manner: \x + \xo 27:12 \xt [See ver. 11 above] \x*“Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and \x + \xo 27:12 \xt ver. 17; [ch. 38:17]\x*serve him and his people and live.

\v 16 Then I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 27:16 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*Do not listen to the words of your prophets who are prophesying to you, saying, \x + \xo 27:16 \xt ch. 28:3; 2 Kgs. 24:13; 2 Chr. 36:7, 10, 18 \x*‘Behold, the vessels of the \nd Lord\nd*’s house will now shortly be brought back from Babylon,’ \x + \xo 27:16 \xt [See ver. 10 above]\x*for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you.

\p \v 1 In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of \x + \xo 28:1 \xt ch. 27:12 \x*Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fifth month of the fourth year, Hananiah the son of \x + \xo 28:1 \xt Ezek. 11:1 \x*Azzur, the prophet from \x + \xo 28:1 \xt Josh. 9:3; 21:17\x*Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, in the presence of the priests and all the people, saying,

\p
\v 5 Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Hananiah the prophet in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the \nd Lord\nd*,

\v 10 Then the prophet Hananiah took the \x + \xo 28:10 \xt ch. 27:2\x*yoke-bars from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke them.
\v 11 And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, \x + \xo 28:11 \xt [1 Kgs. 22:11] \x*“Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 28:11 \xt ver. 2, 3 \x*Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of \x + \xo 28:11 \xt ch. 27:7\x*all the nations within two years.” But Jeremiah the prophet went his way.

\v 12 Sometime after the prophet \x + \xo 28:12 \xt ver. 1, 10\x*Hananiah had broken the yoke-bars from off the neck of Jeremiah the prophet, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah:
\v 13 “Go, tell Hananiah, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: You have broken wooden bars, but you have made in their place bars of iron.
\v 14 For thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel: I have put upon the neck of all these nations \x + \xo 28:14 \xt Deut. 28:48 \x*an iron yoke to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, \x + \xo 28:14 \xt [ch. 25:11] \x*and they shall serve him, \x + \xo 28:14 \xt See ch. 27:6\x*for I have given to him even the beasts of the field.’”
\v 15 And Jeremiah the prophet said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah, \x + \xo 28:15 \xt ch. 29:31; Deut. 18:20; [Ezek. 13:22, 23] \x*the \nd Lord\nd* has not sent you, \x + \xo 28:15 \xt See ch. 5:31\x*and you have made this people trust in a lie.
\v 16 Therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: ‘Behold, I will remove you from the face of the earth. This year you shall die, \x + \xo 28:16 \xt ch. 29:32; Deut. 13:5\x*because you have uttered rebellion against the \nd Lord\nd*.’”
\p

\s1 Jeremiah’s Letter to the Exiles
\p \v 1 These are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to \x + \xo 29:1 \xt Ezek. 8:1 \x*the surviving elders of the exiles, and to \x + \xo 29:1 \xt [ch. 23:33]\x*the priests, \x + \xo 29:1 \xt [ch. 23:33]\x*the prophets, and \x + \xo 29:1 \xt [ch. 23:33]\x*all the people, whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
\v 2 This was after \x + \xo 29:2 \xt ch. 24:1; 2 Kgs. 24:12, 14\x*King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the eunuchs, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the metal workers had departed from Jerusalem.
\v 3 The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah the son of \x + \xo 29:3 \xt 2 Chr. 34:8 \x*Shaphan and Gemariah the son of \x + \xo 29:3 \xt 1 Chr. 6:13\x*Hilkiah, whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. It said:
\v 4 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon:
\v 5 \x + \xo 29:5 \xt ver. 28\x*Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
\v 6 Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease.

\p
\v 15 “Because you have said, ‘The \nd Lord\nd* has raised up prophets for us in Babylon,’

\s1 Shemaiah’s False Prophecy
\p
\v 24 To \x + \xo 29:24 \xt ver. 31, 32\x*Shemaiah of Nehelam you shall say:

\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 29:29 \xt [See ver. 25 above]\x*Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the hearing of Jeremiah the prophet.
\v 30 \x + \xo 29:30 \xt ver. 1, 20\x*Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah:

\v 3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why do you prophesy and say, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 32:3 \xt ver. 25, 36, 43; ch. 21:10; 34:2; 37:17; 38:3\x*Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall capture it;

\p \v 1 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah a second time, while he was still \x + \xo 33:1 \xt See ch. 32:2\x*shut up in the court of the guard:

\v 14 \x + \xo 33:14 \xt For ver. 14-16, see ch. 23:5, 6 \x*“Behold, the days are coming, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, when \x + \xo 33:14 \xt ch. 29:10\x*I will fulfill the promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.

\p
\v 17 “For thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 33:17 \xt 2 Sam. 7:16; 1 Kgs. 2:4; Ps. 89:3, 4\x*David shall never lack a man to sit on the throne of the house of Israel,

\p
\v 19 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah:

\p
\v 23 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah:
\v 24 “Have you not observed that these people are saying, ‘The \nd Lord\nd* has rejected the two clans that he chose’? Thus they have despised my people so that they are no longer a nation in their sight.

\s1 Zedekiah to Die in Babylon
\p \v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd*, when \x + \xo 34:1 \xt ch. 39:1; 52:4; 2 Kgs. 25:1 \x*Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army \x + \xo 34:1 \xt ch. 1:15; [ch. 51:28]\x*and all the kingdoms of the earth under his dominion and all the peoples were fighting against Jerusalem and all of its cities:
\v 2 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel: Go and speak to \x + \xo 34:2 \xt 2 Kgs. 25:2 \x*Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 34:2 \xt See ch. 21:10\x*Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.
\v 3 \x + \xo 34:3 \xt See ch. 32:4\x*You shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured and delivered into his hand. \x + \xo 34:3 \xt See ch. 32:4\x*You shall see the king of Babylon eye to eye and speak with him face to face. And you shall go to Babylon.’
\v 4 Yet hear the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, O Zedekiah king of Judah! \x + \xo 34:4 \xt [ch. 38:17, 20; 39:4, 7]\x*Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* concerning you: \x + \xo 34:4 \xt [ch. 38:17, 20; 39:4, 7]\x*‘You shall not die by the sword.

\p
\v 6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem,
\v 7 when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, \x + \xo 34:7 \xt Josh. 10:3 \x*Lachish and \x + \xo 34:7 \xt Josh. 10:10; 15:35 \x*Azekah, \x + \xo 34:7 \xt 2 Kgs. 18:13 \x*for these were the only \x + \xo 34:7 \xt ch. 4:5\x*fortified cities of Judah that remained.
\p
\v 8 The word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd*, after King Zedekiah \x + \xo 34:8 \xt ver. 15 \x*had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem \x + \xo 34:8 \xt ver. 15, 17; Ex. 21:2; Lev. 25:10; [Isa. 61:1]\x*to make a proclamation of liberty to them,

\v 10 And they obeyed, all the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant that everyone would set free his slave, male or female, so that they would not be enslaved again. They obeyed and set them free.
\v 11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves \x + \xo 34:11 \xt [See ver. 9 above]\x*they had set free, and brought them into subjection as slaves.
\v 12 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd*:
\v 13 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel: I myself made a covenant with your fathers when \x + \xo 34:13 \xt Ex. 20:2\x*I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, saying,

\v 15 You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes \x + \xo 34:15 \xt [See ver. 8 above] \x*by proclaiming liberty, each to his neighbor, and \x + \xo 34:15 \xt ver. 8; [2 Kgs. 23:3] \x*you made a covenant before me in the \x + \xo 34:15 \xt See ch. 7:10\x*house that is called by my name,
\v 16 but then you turned around \x + \xo 34:16 \xt Lev. 18:21; 19:12 \x*and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves, \x + \xo 34:16 \xt ver. 11\x*whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your slaves.
\p
\v 17 “Therefore, thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: You have not obeyed me \x + \xo 34:17 \xt [See ver. 8 above] \x*by proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother and to his neighbor; \x + \xo 34:17 \xt [Matt. 7:2; Gal. 6:7; James 2:13] \x*behold, I proclaim to you liberty \x + \xo 34:17 \xt See ch. 14:12 \x*to the sword, to pestilence, and to famine, declares the \nd Lord\nd*. \x + \xo 34:17 \xt See ch. 15:4\x*I will make you a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.

\c 35
\s1 The Obedience of the Rechabites
\p \v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd* in the days of \x + \xo 35:1 \xt ch. 25:1\x*Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah:
\v 2 “Go to the house of the \x + \xo 35:2 \xt 1 Chr. 2:55 \x*Rechabites and speak with them and bring them to the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, into one of \x + \xo 35:2 \xt 1 Kgs. 6:5, 6; 1 Chr. 9:26, 33\x*the chambers; then offer them wine to drink.”
\v 3 So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons and the whole house of the Rechabites.
\v 4 I brought them to the house of the \nd Lord\nd* into \x + \xo 35:4 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, \x + \xo 35:4 \xt [Deut. 33:1] \x*the man of God, which was near \x + \xo 35:4 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*the chamber of the officials, above \x + \xo 35:4 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*the chamber of \x + \xo 35:4 \xt ch. 21:1; 29:25; 37:3 \x*Maaseiah the son of Shallum, \x + \xo 35:4 \xt 2 Kgs. 12:9; 25:18\x*keeper of the threshold.
\v 5 Then I set before the Rechabites pitchers full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, “Drink wine.”
\v 6 But they answered, “We will drink no wine, for \x + \xo 35:6 \xt 2 Kgs. 10:15, 23\x*Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine, neither you nor your sons forever.
\v 7 You shall not build a house; you shall not sow seed; you shall not plant or have a vineyard; but you shall live in tents all your days, \x + \xo 35:7 \xt [Ex. 20:12; Eph. 6:2, 3]\x*that you may live many days in the land where you sojourn.’
\v 8 We have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, ourselves, our wives, our sons, or our daughters,
\v 9 and not to build houses to dwell in. We have no vineyard or field or seed,
\v 10 but we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
\v 11 But \x + \xo 35:11 \xt ch. 46:2; 2 Kgs. 24:1; [ver. 1] \x*when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, ‘Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of \x + \xo 35:11 \xt 2 Kgs. 24:2 \x*the army of the Chaldeans and \x + \xo 35:11 \xt 2 Kgs. 24:2 \x*the army of the Syrians.’ \x + \xo 35:11 \xt [ver. 7]\x*So we are living in Jerusalem.”
\p
\v 12 Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah:
\v 13 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, \x + \xo 35:13 \xt See ch. 5:3\x*Will you not receive instruction and listen to my words? declares the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 14 The command that Jonadab the son of Rechab gave to his sons, to drink no wine, has been kept, and they drink none to this day, for they have obeyed their father’s command. I have spoken to you \x + \xo 35:14 \xt See ch. 25:3\x*persistently, but you have not listened to me.
\v 15 I have sent to you all my servants the prophets, sending them \x + \xo 35:15 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*persistently, saying, \x + \xo 35:15 \xt 2 Kgs. 17:13; See ch. 18:11 \x*‘Turn now every one of you from his evil way, and amend your deeds, and \x + \xo 35:15 \xt See ch. 7:6 \x*do not go after other gods to serve them, and then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to you and your fathers.’ \x + \xo 35:15 \xt See ch. 34:14\x*But you did not incline your ear or listen to me.
\v 16 The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command that their father gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.
\v 17 Therefore, thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing upon Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, \x + \xo 35:17 \xt [Isa. 50:2]\x*because I have spoken to them and they have not listened, \x + \xo 35:17 \xt [Isa. 50:2]\x*I have called to them and they have not answered.”

\v 18 But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel: Because you have obeyed the command of Jonadab your father and kept all his precepts and done all that he commanded you,
\v 19 therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel: Jonadab the son of Rechab shall never lack a man \x + \xo 35:19 \xt See ch. 15:1\x*to stand before me.”

\s1 Jehoiakim Burns Jeremiah’s Scroll
\p \v 1 In the \x + \xo 36:1 \xt ch. 25:1; 45:1; [ver. 9]\x*fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd*:
\v 2 “Take \x + \xo 36:2 \xt Ezra 6:2; Ps. 40:7; Ezek. 2:9; Zech. 5:1, 2 \x*a scroll and \x + \xo 36:2 \xt ch. 30:2; [ch. 51:60] \x*write on it all the words that I have spoken to you against Israel and \x + \xo 36:2 \xt ch. 25:2 \x*Judah \x + \xo 36:2 \xt See ch. 25:15-26; 46–51 \x*and all the nations, \x + \xo 36:2 \xt ch. 1:2; 25:3\x*from the day I spoke to you, from the days of Josiah until today.
\v 3 \x + \xo 36:3 \xt ch. 26:3; Ezek. 12:3; Zeph. 2:3; [Amos 5:15] \x*It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, \x + \xo 36:3 \xt [ch. 18:8] \x*so that every one may turn from his evil way, and \x + \xo 36:3 \xt See ch. 31:34\x*that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.”
\p
\v 4 Then Jeremiah called \x + \xo 36:4 \xt See ch. 32:12 \x*Baruch the son of Neriah, and \x + \xo 36:4 \xt See ch. 32:12 \x*Baruch wrote on \x + \xo 36:4 \xt [See ver. 2 above]\x*a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the \nd Lord\nd* that he had spoken to him.
\v 5 And Jeremiah ordered \x + \xo 36:5 \xt [See ver. 4 above] \x*Baruch, saying, \x + \xo 36:5 \xt ch. 32:2; 33:1; 39:15\x*“I am banned from going to the house of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\v 6 so you are to go, and \x + \xo 36:6 \xt [ver. 9]\x*on a day of fasting in the hearing of all the people in the \nd Lord\nd*’s house you shall read the words of the \nd Lord\nd* from the scroll that you have written at my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities.
\v 7 \x + \xo 36:7 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*It may be that their plea for mercy will come before the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 36:7 \xt [See ver. 3 above]\x*and that every one will turn from his evil way, for great is the anger and wrath that the \nd Lord\nd* has pronounced against this people.”
\v 8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did all that Jeremiah the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the \nd Lord\nd* in the \nd Lord\nd*’s house.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 36:9 \xt [ver. 1] \x*In the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, \x + \xo 36:9 \xt ver. 22 \x*in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem \x + \xo 36:9 \xt [2 Chr. 20:3]\x*proclaimed a fast before the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 10 Then, in the hearing of all the people, Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll, in the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, in \x + \xo 36:10 \xt [ch. 35:2]\x*the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the secretary, which was in the upper court, at the entry of the New Gate of the \nd Lord\nd*’s house.
\p
\v 11 When Micaiah the son of Gemariah, son of \x + \xo 36:11 \xt ch. 26:24; 40:5; 2 Chr. 34:8, 15, 18\x*Shaphan, heard all the words of the \nd Lord\nd* from the scroll,
\v 12 he went down to the king’s house, into the secretary’s chamber, and \x + \xo 36:12 \xt ch. 26:10 \x*all the officials were sitting there: \x + \xo 36:12 \xt ver. 20; ch. 41:1; 2 Kgs. 25:25 \x*Elishama the secretary, \x + \xo 36:12 \xt ver. 25 \x*Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, \x + \xo 36:12 \xt ver. 25 \x*Elnathan \x + \xo 36:12 \xt ch. 26:22\x*the son of Achbor, \x + \xo 36:12 \xt ver. 25 \x*Gemariah the son of \x + \xo 36:12 \xt ch. 26:22\x*Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the officials.
\v 13 And Micaiah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.
\v 14 Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, son of \x + \xo 36:14 \xt ver. 26; ch. 37:3, 13; 38:1\x*Shelemiah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, “Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.
\v 15 And they said to him, “Sit down and read it.” So Baruch read it to them.
\v 16 When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear. And they said to Baruch, \x + \xo 36:16 \xt ver. 20\x*“We must report all these words to the king.”
\v 17 Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, please, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?”
\v 18 Baruch answered them, “He dictated all these words to me, \x + \xo 36:18 \xt ver. 32; [Rom. 16:22]\x*while I wrote them with ink on the scroll.”
\v 19 Then the officials said to Baruch, “Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are.”
\p
\v 20 So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in \x + \xo 36:20 \xt ver. 12\x*the chamber of Elishama the secretary, and they reported all the words to the king.
\v 21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the secretary. And Jehudi read it to the king and all the officials who stood beside the king.
\v 22 It was \x + \xo 36:22 \xt ver. 9; [John 10:22] \x*the ninth month, and the king was sitting in \x + \xo 36:22 \xt Amos 3:15\x*the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him.
\v 23 As Jehudi read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire in the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the fire pot.
\v 24 Yet \x + \xo 36:24 \xt [ver. 16] \x*neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, \x + \xo 36:24 \xt See Josh. 7:6\x*nor did they tear their garments.
\v 25 Even when \x + \xo 36:25 \xt ver. 12 \x*Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah \x + \xo 36:25 \xt [Isa. 59:16]\x*urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
\v 26 And the king commanded Jerahmeel the \x + \xo 36:26 \xt [1 Kgs. 22:26; Zeph. 1:8] \x*king’s son and Seraiah the son of Azriel and \x + \xo 36:26 \xt ver. 14 \x*Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize \x + \xo 36:26 \xt See ch. 45:1-3\x*Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the \nd Lord\nd* hid them.
\p
\v 27 Now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote at Jeremiah’s dictation, the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah:
\v 28 “Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
\v 29 And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, You have burned this scroll, saying, \x + \xo 36:29 \xt See ch. 26:9\x*“Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?”
\v 30 Therefore thus says the \nd Lord\nd* concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: \x + \xo 36:30 \xt [ch. 22:30] \x*He shall have none \x + \xo 36:30 \xt [ch. 22:2, 4] \x*to sit on the throne of David, \x + \xo 36:30 \xt [ch. 22:19]\x*and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.
\v 31 \x + \xo 36:31 \xt [ch. 1:16]\x*And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity. I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the people of Judah all the disaster that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.’”
\p
\v 32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to \x + \xo 36:32 \xt See ver. 4 \x*Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who \x + \xo 36:32 \xt ver. 18\x*wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to them.

\s1 Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 37:1 \xt 2 Kgs. 24:17; 2 Chr. 36:10 \x*Zedekiah the son of Josiah, \x + \xo 37:1 \xt [Ezek. 17:13] \x*whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah, reigned instead of \x + \xo 37:1 \xt ch. 22:24\x*Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.
\v 2 \x + \xo 37:2 \xt See 2 Chr. 36:12-14\x*But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the \nd Lord\nd* that he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
\p
\v 3 King Zedekiah sent \x + \xo 37:3 \xt [ch. 38:1] \x*Jehucal the son of \x + \xo 37:3 \xt ver. 13; ch. 38:1 \x*Shelemiah, and \x + \xo 37:3 \xt See ch. 21:1 \x*Zephaniah the priest, the son of \x + \xo 37:3 \xt See ch. 35:4 \x*Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet, saying, “Please \x + \xo 37:3 \xt [ch. 21:2]\x*pray for us to the \nd Lord\nd* our God.”
\v 4 \x + \xo 37:4 \xt [Num. 27:17] \x*Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, \x + \xo 37:4 \xt [ch. 32:2; 33:1]\x*for he had not yet been put in prison.
\v 5 \x + \xo 37:5 \xt [Ezek. 17:15] \x*The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt. And when \x + \xo 37:5 \xt ch. 32:2 \x*the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news about them, \x + \xo 37:5 \xt ver. 11; ch. 34:21\x*they withdrew from Jerusalem.
\p
\v 6 Then the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah the prophet:
\v 7 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Judah who \x + \xo 37:7 \xt [ch. 21:2] \x*sent you to me to inquire of me, ‘Behold, \x + \xo 37:7 \xt [Ezek. 29:2, 6] \x*Pharaoh’s army that came to help you is about to \x + \xo 37:7 \xt [ch. 46:17; 2 Kgs. 24:7; Lam. 4:17]\x*return to Egypt, to its own land.
\v 8 And \x + \xo 37:8 \xt ch. 34:22\x*the Chaldeans shall come back and fight against this city. \x + \xo 37:8 \xt ch. 34:22\x*They shall capture it and burn it with fire.
\v 9 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, Do not deceive yourselves, saying, “The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,” for they will not go away.
\v 10 \x + \xo 37:10 \xt [ch. 21:4] \x*For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chaldeans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and \x + \xo 37:10 \xt [See ver. 8 above]\x*burn this city with fire.’”
\s1 Jeremiah Imprisoned
\p
\v 11 Now when \x + \xo 37:11 \xt ver. 5\x*the Chaldean army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh’s army,
\v 12 Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to \x + \xo 37:12 \xt ch. 1:1; 32:8 \x*the land of Benjamin \x + \xo 37:12 \xt [ch. 32:9] \x*to receive his portion there \x + \xo 37:12 \xt ver. 4; ch. 39:14\x*among the people.
\v 13 When he was at \x + \xo 37:13 \xt ch. 38:7; Zech. 14:10 \x*the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Irijah the son of \x + \xo 37:13 \xt ver. 3; ch. 38:1 \x*Shelemiah, son of Hananiah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, \x + \xo 37:13 \xt [ch. 21:9; 38:19; 39:9; 52:15]\x*“You are deserting to the Chaldeans.”
\v 14 And Jeremiah said, “It is a lie; I am not deserting to the Chaldeans.” But Irijah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to \x + \xo 37:14 \xt ch. 36:12\x*the officials.
\v 15 And the officials were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him \x + \xo 37:15 \xt [Heb. 11:36]\x*and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 37:16 \xt See ch. 38:6-14\x*When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells and remained there many days,
\v 17 King Zedekiah sent for him and received him. The king questioned him \x + \xo 37:17 \xt ch. 38:16 \x*secretly in his house and said, “Is there any word from the \nd Lord\nd*?” Jeremiah said, “There is.” Then he said, \x + \xo 37:17 \xt See ch. 21:7\x*“You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.”
\v 18 Jeremiah also said to King Zedekiah, “What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, \x + \xo 37:18 \xt [See ver. 15 above]\x*that you have put me in prison?
\v 19 \x + \xo 37:19 \xt [ch. 28:2, 11, 17]\x*Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land’?
\v 20 Now hear, please, O my lord the king: \x + \xo 37:20 \xt [ch. 38:26] \x*let my humble plea come before you and \x + \xo 37:20 \xt [ch. 38:28]\x*do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the secretary, lest I die there.”
\v 21 So King Zedekiah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to \x + \xo 37:21 \xt See ch. 32:2 \x*the court of the guard. And a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers’ street, \x + \xo 37:21 \xt ch. 38:9; 52:6; Ezek. 4:10, 16\x*until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in \x + \xo 37:21 \xt See ch. 32:2 \x*the court of the guard.
\c 38
\s1 Jeremiah Cast into the Cistern
\p \v 1 Now Shephatiah the son of Mattan, Gedaliah the son of Pashhur, \x + \xo 38:1 \xt [ch. 37:3] \x*Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and \x + \xo 38:1 \xt See ch. 20:1\x*Pashhur the son of Malchiah heard the words that Jeremiah was saying to all the people,
\v 2 “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 38:2 \xt ch. 21:9; [ver. 17, 18]\x*He who stays in this city shall die by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence, \x + \xo 38:2 \xt ch. 21:9; [ver. 17, 18]\x*but he who goes out to the Chaldeans shall live. He shall have his life as a prize of war, and live.
\v 3 Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 38:3 \xt See ch. 32:3\x*This city shall surely be given into the hand of the army of the king of Babylon and be taken.”
\v 4 Then the officials said to the king, \x + \xo 38:4 \xt ch. 26:11 \x*“Let this man be put to death, \x + \xo 38:4 \xt See ch. 6:24 \x*for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking \x + \xo 38:4 \xt [ch. 33:9]\x*the welfare of this people, but their harm.”
\v 5 King Zedekiah said, “Behold, he is in your hands, \x + \xo 38:5 \xt See ver. 24-28\x*for the king can do nothing against you.”
\v 6 So they took Jeremiah \x + \xo 38:6 \xt ch. 37:16 \x*and cast him into the cistern of Malchiah, the king’s son, which was in \x + \xo 38:6 \xt See ch. 32:2 \x*the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down \x + \xo 38:6 \xt ver. 11, 13 \x*by ropes. \x + \xo 38:6 \xt [Gen. 37:24; Zech. 9:11] \x*And there was no water in the cistern, but only mud, and \x + \xo 38:6 \xt [Ps. 69:14]\x*Jeremiah sank in the mud.
\s1 Jeremiah Rescued from the Cistern
\p
\v 7 When \x + \xo 38:7 \xt ch. 39:16 \x*Ebed-melech \x + \xo 38:7 \xt [Acts 8:27] \x*the Ethiopian, \x + \xo 38:7 \xt ch. 29:2; Isa. 56:3, 4 \x*a eunuch who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern—the king was sitting \x + \xo 38:7 \xt See ch. 37:13\x*in the Benjamin Gate—
\v 8 \x + \xo 38:8 \xt [See ver. 7 above]\x*Ebed-melech went from the king’s house and said to the king,
\v 9 “My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they did to Jeremiah the prophet by casting him into the cistern, and he will die there of \x + \xo 38:9 \xt ch. 11:22; [ch. 14:16, 18; 19:9] \x*hunger, \x + \xo 38:9 \xt [ch. 37:21]\x*for there is no bread left in the city.”
\v 10 Then the king commanded \x + \xo 38:10 \xt [See ver. 7 above]\x*Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, “Take thirty men with you from here, and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies.”
\v 11 So \x + \xo 38:11 \xt [See ver. 7 above] \x*Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the house of the king, to a wardrobe in the storehouse, and took from there old rags and worn-out clothes, which he let down to Jeremiah in the cistern \x + \xo 38:11 \xt ver. 6\x*by ropes.
\v 12 Then \x + \xo 38:12 \xt [See ver. 7 above] \x*Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, “Put the rags and clothes between your armpits and \x + \xo 38:12 \xt [See ver. 11 above]\x*the ropes.” Jeremiah did so.
\v 13 Then they drew Jeremiah up with \x + \xo 38:13 \xt [See ver. 11 above] \x*ropes and lifted him out of the cistern. And Jeremiah remained in the \x + \xo 38:13 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*court of the guard.
\s1 Jeremiah Warns Zedekiah Again
\p
\v 14 King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and received him at the third entrance of the temple of the \nd Lord\nd*. The king said to Jeremiah, “I will ask you a question; hide nothing from me.”
\v 15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, will you not surely put me to death? And if I give you counsel, you will not listen to me.”
\v 16 Then King Zedekiah swore \x + \xo 38:16 \xt ch. 37:17 \x*secretly to Jeremiah, \x + \xo 38:16 \xt See Ruth 3:13 \x*“As the \nd Lord\nd* lives, \x + \xo 38:16 \xt [Isa. 57:16] \x*who made our souls, I will not put you to death or deliver you into the hand of \x + \xo 38:16 \xt See ver. 1-9\x*these men who seek your life.”
\p
\v 17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of hosts, the God of Israel: \x + \xo 38:17 \xt ver. 2, 21; [ch. 27:12, 13; 2 Kgs. 24:12] \x*If you will surrender to \x + \xo 38:17 \xt ch. 39:3 \x*the officials of the king of Babylon, \x + \xo 38:17 \xt [ch. 34:4, 5]\x*then your life shall be spared, and this city shall not be burned with fire, and you and your house shall live.
\v 18 But if you do not surrender to \x + \xo 38:18 \xt [See ver. 17 above] \x*the officials of the king of Babylon, \x + \xo 38:18 \xt See ch. 21:10\x*then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, \x + \xo 38:18 \xt See ch. 21:10\x*and they shall burn it with fire, and you shall not escape from their hand.”
\v 19 King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am afraid of the Judeans \x + \xo 38:19 \xt See ch. 37:13\x*who have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest I be handed over to them and they deal cruelly with me.”
\v 20 Jeremiah said, “You shall not be given to them. Obey now the voice of the \nd Lord\nd* in what I say to you, \x + \xo 38:20 \xt ch. 40:9\x*and it shall be well with you, and your life shall be spared.
\v 21 But if you refuse to \x + \xo 38:21 \xt [See ver. 17 above]\x*surrender, this is the vision which the \nd Lord\nd* has shown to me:
\v 22 Behold, all the women left in the house of the king of Judah were being led out to the officials of the king of Babylon and were saying,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 38:22 \xt See ch. 20:10\x*“‘Your trusted friends have deceived you
\q2 and prevailed against you;
\q1 now that your feet are sunk in the mud,
\q2 they turn away from you.’
\b
\m
\v 23 All your wives and \x + \xo 38:23 \xt ch. 39:6; 41:10; 43:6\x*your sons shall be led out to the Chaldeans, and you yourself shall not escape from their hand, but shall be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burned with fire.”
\p
\v 24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Let no one know of these words, and you shall not die.
\v 25 If \x + \xo 38:25 \xt [ver. 5]\x*the officials hear that I have spoken with you and come to you and say to you, ‘Tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you; hide nothing from us and we will not put you to death,’
\v 26 then you shall say to them, \x + \xo 38:26 \xt [ch. 37:20]\x*‘I made a humble plea to the king that he would not send me back to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”
\v 27 Then all the officials came to Jeremiah and asked him, and he answered them as the king had instructed him. So they stopped speaking with him, for the conversation had not been overheard.
\v 28 And Jeremiah remained \x + \xo 38:28 \xt See ch. 32:2\x*in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken.

\v 2 In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, a breach was made in the city.
\v 3 Then all \x + \xo 39:3 \xt ch. 38:17, 18, 22 \x*the officials of the king of Babylon came \x + \xo 39:3 \xt [ch. 1:15] \x*and sat in the middle gate: Nergal-sar-ezer of Samgar, Nebu-sar-sekim \x + \xo 39:3 \xt ver. 13; 2 Kgs. 18:17\x*the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, with all the rest of the officers of the king of Babylon.
\v 4 When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled, going out of the city at night by way of the king’s garden through the gate between the two walls; and they went toward \x + \xo 39:4 \xt See Deut. 1:1\x*the Arabah.
\v 5 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in \x + \xo 39:5 \xt Josh. 5:10 \x*the plains of Jericho. And when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, at \x + \xo 39:5 \xt See 2 Kgs. 23:33 \x*Riblah, in the land of Hamath; \x + \xo 39:5 \xt [Ezek. 17:15]\x*and he passed sentence on him.
\v 6 The king of Babylon \x + \xo 39:6 \xt ch. 52:10 \x*slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah at \x + \xo 39:6 \xt [See ver. 5 above]\x*Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon \x + \xo 39:6 \xt ch. 52:10 \x*slaughtered all the nobles of Judah.
\v 7 \x + \xo 39:7 \xt [ch. 32:4; Ezek. 12:13]\x*He put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains to take him to Babylon.
\v 8 \x + \xo 39:8 \xt See ch. 21:10 \x*The Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the house of the people, \x + \xo 39:8 \xt Neh. 1:3; [Ps. 80:12; Isa. 5:5]\x*and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
\v 9 Then \x + \xo 39:9 \xt ch. 40:1; 52:12; 2 Kgs. 25:8 \x*Nebuzaradan, the \x + \xo 39:9 \xt Gen. 37:36 \x*captain of the guard, carried into exile to Babylon the rest of the people who were left in the city, \x + \xo 39:9 \xt See ch. 37:13\x*those who had deserted to him, and the people who remained.
\v 10 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, \x + \xo 39:10 \xt ch. 40:7; 2 Kgs. 25:12\x*left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
\s1 The \nd Lord\nd* Delivers Jeremiah
\p
\v 11 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave command concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, saying,
\v 12 \x + \xo 39:12 \xt ch. 40:4\x*“Take him, look after him well, and do him no harm, but deal with him as he tells you.”
\v 13 So \x + \xo 39:13 \xt [ver. 3]\x*Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, Nebushazban the Rab-saris, Nergal-sar-ezer the Rab-mag, \x + \xo 39:13 \xt [ver. 3]\x*and all the chief officers of the king of Babylon
\v 14 sent and took Jeremiah from \x + \xo 39:14 \xt ch. 38:28; See ch. 32:2 \x*the court of the guard. They entrusted him to \x + \xo 39:14 \xt ch. 43:6; See ch. 40:5-9, 11-16; 41:1-4, 6; 2 Kgs. 25:22-25 \x*Gedaliah the son of \x + \xo 39:14 \xt 2 Kgs. 22:12 \x*Ahikam, son of \x + \xo 39:14 \xt 2 Kgs. 22:3 \x*Shaphan, that he should take him home. So \x + \xo 39:14 \xt ch. 37:12\x*he lived among the people.
\p
\v 15 The word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah \x + \xo 39:15 \xt ch. 36:5; 38:13\x*while he was shut up in the court of the guard:
\v 16 “Go, and say to \x + \xo 39:16 \xt See ch. 38:7 \x*Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, ‘Thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel: \x + \xo 39:16 \xt Dan. 9:12 \x*Behold, I will fulfill my words against this city for harm and \x + \xo 39:16 \xt ch. 21:10; [ch. 14:11]\x*not for good, and they shall be accomplished before you on that day.
\v 17 But I will deliver you on that day, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, and you shall not be given into the hand of the men \x + \xo 39:17 \xt ch. 22:25\x*of whom you are afraid.
\v 18 For I will surely save you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but you shall have your \x + \xo 39:18 \xt ch. 21:9; 45:5 \x*life as a prize of war, \x + \xo 39:18 \xt Ps. 25:2; 37:40\x*because you have put your trust in me, declares the \nd Lord\nd*.’”
\c 40
\s1 Jeremiah Remains in Judah
\p \v 1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 40:1 \xt [ch. 39:14] \x*after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from \x + \xo 40:1 \xt Josh. 18:25 \x*Ramah, when he took him \x + \xo 40:1 \xt [Ps. 149:8]\x*bound in chains along with all the captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being exiled to Babylon.
\v 2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, \x + \xo 40:2 \xt [Deut. 29:24, 28]\x*“The \nd Lord\nd* your God pronounced this disaster against this place.
\v 3 The \nd Lord\nd* has brought it about, and has done as he said. \x + \xo 40:3 \xt ch. 44:3, 23; Deut. 29:25; See Dan. 9:10-12\x*Because you sinned against the \nd Lord\nd* and did not obey his voice, this thing has come upon you.
\v 4 Now, behold, I release you today from \x + \xo 40:4 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*the chains on your hands. \x + \xo 40:4 \xt [ch. 39:12] \x*If it seems good to you to come with me to Babylon, come, and I will look after you well, \x + \xo 40:4 \xt [ch. 39:12] \x*but if it seems wrong to you to come with me to Babylon, do not come. \x + \xo 40:4 \xt [Gen. 20:15]\x*See, the whole land is before you; go wherever you think it good and right to go.
\v 5 If you remain,\f + \fr 40:5 \ft Syriac; the meaning of the Hebrew phrase is uncertain\f* then return to \x + \xo 40:5 \xt See ch. 39:14 \x*Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, \x + \xo 40:5 \xt ch. 41:2\x*whom the king of Babylon appointed governor of the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people. Or go wherever you think it right to go.” So the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a present, and let him go.
\v 6 Then Jeremiah went to \x + \xo 40:6 \xt [See ver. 5 above] \x*Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at \x + \xo 40:6 \xt ch. 41:6; Josh. 18:26 \x*Mizpah, and lived with him \x + \xo 40:6 \xt ch. 37:12; 39:14 \x*among the people \x + \xo 40:6 \xt ch. 39:10\x*who were left in the land.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 40:7 \xt For ver. 7-9, see 2 Kgs. 25:23, 24 \x*When all the captains of the forces in the open country and their men heard that \x + \xo 40:7 \xt ver. 5 \x*the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land and had committed to him men, women, and children, those of \x + \xo 40:7 \xt ch. 39:10; 2 Kgs. 25:12\x*the poorest of the land who had not been taken into exile to Babylon,
\v 8 they went to Gedaliah at \x + \xo 40:8 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*Mizpah—\x + \xo 40:8 \xt ver. 14, 15, 16; See ch. 41:1-3 \x*Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, \x + \xo 40:8 \xt ver. 13, 15, 16; ch. 42:1, 8 \x*Johanan the son of Kareah, Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, \x + \xo 40:8 \xt ch. 42:1\x*Jezaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.
\v 9 Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore to them and their men, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, \x + \xo 40:9 \xt ch. 38:20\x*and it shall be well with you.
\v 10 As for me, I will dwell at \x + \xo 40:10 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*Mizpah, to represent you before the Chaldeans who will come to us. But as for you, \x + \xo 40:10 \xt [ver. 12]\x*gather wine and summer fruits and oil, and store them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that you have taken.”
\v 11 Likewise, when all the Judeans who were in \x + \xo 40:11 \xt [Num. 22:1; 2 Sam. 8:2] \x*Moab and among \x + \xo 40:11 \xt 1 Sam. 11:1; 12:12 \x*the Ammonites and in \x + \xo 40:11 \xt Gen. 36:8\x*Edom and in other lands heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and had appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, as governor over them,
\v 12 \x + \xo 40:12 \xt [ch. 43:5] \x*then all the Judeans returned from all the places to which they had been driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah. And they \x + \xo 40:12 \xt [ver. 10]\x*gathered wine and summer fruits in great abundance.
\p
\v 13 Now \x + \xo 40:13 \xt ver. 8, 15, 16; ch. 42:1, 8 \x*Johanan the son of Kareah and \x + \xo 40:13 \xt ch. 41:11; 42:1\x*all the leaders of the forces in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah
\v 14 and said to him, “Do you know that Baalis the king of \x + \xo 40:14 \xt [ch. 41:10]\x*the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to take your life?” But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam would not believe them.
\v 15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly to Gedaliah at Mizpah, “Please let me go and strike down Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know it. Why should he take your life, so that all the Judeans who are gathered about you would be scattered, \x + \xo 40:15 \xt [ch. 42:2]\x*and the remnant of Judah would perish?”
\v 16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, “You shall not do this thing, for you are speaking falsely of Ishmael.”
\c 41
\s1 Gedaliah Murdered
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 41:1 \xt 2 Kgs. 25:25 \x*In the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, came with ten men to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, at \x + \xo 41:1 \xt See ch. 40:6, 8, 10 \x*Mizpah. As they \x + \xo 41:1 \xt [Ps. 41:9]\x*ate bread together there at Mizpah,
\v 2 \x + \xo 41:2 \xt [2 Sam. 13:28, 29] \x*Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men with him rose up and struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword, and killed him, \x + \xo 41:2 \xt ch. 40:5\x*whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor in the land.
\v 3 Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at \x + \xo 41:3 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*Mizpah, and the Chaldean soldiers who happened to be there.
\p
\v 4 On the day after the murder of Gedaliah, before anyone knew of it,
\v 5 eighty men arrived from \x + \xo 41:5 \xt Josh. 17:7 \x*Shechem and \x + \xo 41:5 \xt Josh. 18:1 \x*Shiloh and \x + \xo 41:5 \xt 1 Kgs. 16:24; See ch. 23:13 \x*Samaria, with \x + \xo 41:5 \xt [ch. 48:37; Deut. 14:1; Isa. 15:2] \x*their beards shaved and \x + \xo 41:5 \xt ch. 36:24 \x*their clothes torn, and \x + \xo 41:5 \xt [ch. 48:37; Deut. 14:1; Isa. 15:2] \x*their bodies gashed, \x + \xo 41:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 25:9]\x*bringing grain offerings and incense to present at the temple of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah came out from \x + \xo 41:6 \xt ch. 40:6, 8, 10\x*Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. As he met them, he said to them, “Come in to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.”
\v 7 When they came into the city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and cast them into a cistern.
\v 8 But there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Do not put us to death, for we have \x + \xo 41:8 \xt [Judg. 6:11]\x*stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the fields.” So he refrained and did not put them to death with their companions.
\p
\v 9 Now the cistern into which Ishmael had thrown all the bodies of the men whom he had struck down along with\f + \fr 41:9 \ft Hebrew \fq by the hand of\f* Gedaliah was the large cistern that \x + \xo 41:9 \xt [1 Kgs. 15:22; 2 Chr. 16:6]\x*King Asa had made for defense against \x + \xo 41:9 \xt [1 Kgs. 15:22; 2 Chr. 16:6]\x*Baasha king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.
\v 10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, \x + \xo 41:10 \xt See ch. 38:23 \x*the king’s daughters and all the people who were left at Mizpah, whom \x + \xo 41:10 \xt [ch. 40:7] \x*Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to \x + \xo 41:10 \xt [ch. 40:14]\x*the Ammonites.
\p
\v 11 But when \x + \xo 41:11 \xt See ch. 40:8 \x*Johanan the son of Kareah and \x + \xo 41:11 \xt ch. 40:13\x*all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
\v 12 they took all their men and went to fight against Ishmael the son of Nethaniah. They came upon him at \x + \xo 41:12 \xt [2 Sam. 2:13] \x*the great pool that is in \x + \xo 41:12 \xt Josh. 9:3, 17\x*Gibeon.
\v 13 And when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah and \x + \xo 41:13 \xt ch. 40:13\x*all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced.
\v 14 \x + \xo 41:14 \xt ver. 10, 16\x*So all the people whom Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah turned around and came back, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah.
\v 15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to \x + \xo 41:15 \xt [ch. 40:14]\x*the Ammonites.
\v 16 Then Johanan the son of Kareah and \x + \xo 41:16 \xt [See ver. 13 above] \x*all the leaders of the forces with him took from Mizpah all the rest of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, after he had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam—soldiers, \x + \xo 41:16 \xt ch. 40:7 \x*women, children, and eunuchs, whom Johanan brought back from \x + \xo 41:16 \xt Josh. 9:3, 17\x*Gibeon.
\v 17 And they went and stayed at Geruth \x + \xo 41:17 \xt [2 Sam. 19:37, 38] \x*Chimham near \x + \xo 41:17 \xt [Matt. 2:1, 14]; See Gen. 35:19\x*Bethlehem, intending to go to Egypt
\v 18 because of the Chaldeans. For they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, \x + \xo 41:18 \xt ver. 2; ch. 40:5\x*whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
\c 42
\s1 Warning Against Going to Egypt
\p \v 1 Then \x + \xo 42:1 \xt ch. 40:13; 41:11 \x*all the commanders of the forces, and \x + \xo 42:1 \xt See ch. 40:8 \x*Johanan the son of Kareah and Jezaniah the son of \x + \xo 42:1 \xt ch. 43:2 \x*Hoshaiah, and all the people \x + \xo 42:1 \xt [ch. 6:13]\x*from the least to the greatest, came near
\v 2 and said to Jeremiah the prophet, “Let \x + \xo 42:2 \xt See ch. 36:7 \x*our plea for mercy come before you, and \x + \xo 42:2 \xt ver. 20; [1 Sam. 7:8; 12:19] \x*pray to the \nd Lord\nd* your God for us, for all \x + \xo 42:2 \xt [ch. 40:15; Isa. 37:4] \x*this remnant—\x + \xo 42:2 \xt [Lev. 26:22]\x*because we are left with but a few, as your eyes see us—
\v 3 that \x + \xo 42:3 \xt [ch. 37:17; Ezra 8:21]\x*the \nd Lord\nd* your God may show us the way we should go, and the thing that we should do.”
\v 4 Jeremiah the prophet said to them, “I have heard you. Behold, I will pray to the \nd Lord\nd* your God according to your request, and \x + \xo 42:4 \xt 1 Sam. 3:18; [Num. 22:18]\x*whatever the \nd Lord\nd* answers you I will tell you. \x + \xo 42:4 \xt 1 Sam. 3:18; [Num. 22:18]\x*I will keep nothing back from you.”
\v 5 Then they said to Jeremiah, \x + \xo 42:5 \xt [Gen. 31:50] \x*“May the \nd Lord\nd* be a true and \x + \xo 42:5 \xt [Rev. 1:5; 3:14] \x*faithful witness against us \x + \xo 42:5 \xt Judg. 11:10 \x*if we do not act according to all the word \x + \xo 42:5 \xt ver. 21\x*with which the \nd Lord\nd* your God sends you to us.

\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 42:7 \xt [Ezek. 3:16]\x*At the end of ten days the word of the \nd Lord\nd* came to Jeremiah.
\v 8 Then he summoned \x + \xo 42:8 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*Johanan the son of Kareah and \x + \xo 42:8 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*all the commanders of the forces who were with him, and all the people \x + \xo 42:8 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*from the least to the greatest,
\v 9 and said to them, “Thus says the \nd Lord\nd*, the God of Israel, \x + \xo 42:9 \xt ver. 2, 3\x*to whom you sent me to present your plea for mercy before him:

\v 18 “For thus says the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts, the God of Israel: \x + \xo 42:18 \xt See ch. 7:20 \x*As my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you go to Egypt. \x + \xo 42:18 \xt See ch. 18:16\x*You shall become an execration, a horror, a curse, and a taunt.

\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 49:8 \xt ver. 30 \x*Flee, turn back, dwell in the depths,
\q2 O inhabitants of \x + \xo 49:8 \xt ch. 25:23; Gen. 25:3 \x*Dedan!
\q1 For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him,
\q2 \x + \xo 49:8 \xt ch. 50:27, 31; [ch. 46:21; 50:27]\x*the time when I punish him.
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 49:9 \xt Obad. 5, 6 \x*If grape gatherers came to you,

\q1 \x + \xo 49:9 \xt Obad. 5, 6 \x*If thieves came by night,

\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 49:10 \xt Mal. 1:3 \x*But I have stripped Esau bare;
\q2 \x + \xo 49:10 \xt [See ver. 9 above] \x*I have uncovered his hiding places,
\q2 and he is not able to conceal himself.
\q1 His children are destroyed, and his brothers,
\q2 and his neighbors; and \x + \xo 49:10 \xt ch. 31:15; Isa. 17:14\x*he is no more.
\q1
\v 11 \x + \xo 49:11 \xt [Ps. 10:14, 18; 68:5]\x*Leave your fatherless children; I will keep them alive;

\b
\p
\v 12 For thus says the \nd Lord\nd*: \x + \xo 49:12 \xt ch. 25:28; [Obad. 16] \x*“If those who did not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, \x + \xo 49:12 \xt ch. 25:29\x*will you go unpunished? You shall not go unpunished, but you must drink.
\v 13 \x + \xo 49:13 \xt See ch. 22:5 \x*For I have sworn by myself, declares the \nd Lord\nd*, that \x + \xo 49:13 \xt ver. 22; See ch. 48:24 \x*Bozrah shall become \x + \xo 49:13 \xt See ch. 24:9\x*a horror, a taunt, a waste, and a curse, and all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.”
\b
\q1
\v 14 \x + \xo 49:14 \xt See Obad. 1-4 \x*I have heard a message from the \nd Lord\nd*,

\q1
\v 15 For behold, I will make you small among the nations,

\v 20 Therefore hear the plan that the \nd Lord\nd* has made against \x + \xo 49:20 \xt Ezek. 35:3, 7, 9 \x*Edom and the purposes that he has formed against the inhabitants of \x + \xo 49:20 \xt See ver. 7 \x*Teman: \x + \xo 49:20 \xt ch. 50:45\x*Even the little ones of the flock shall be dragged away.

\v 59 The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah \x + \xo 51:59 \xt [ch. 32:12] \x*the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, \x + \xo 51:59 \xt [ch. 28:1]\x*in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster.
\v 60 \x + \xo 51:60 \xt [ch. 36:2] \x*Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon, \x + \xo 51:60 \xt See ver. 1-58; ch. 50:1-46\x*all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
\v 61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words,
\v 62 and say, ‘O \nd Lord\nd*, you have said concerning this place that you will cut it off, so \x + \xo 51:62 \xt ch. 50:3 \x*that nothing shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, and it shall be \x + \xo 51:62 \xt ver. 26\x*desolate forever.’

\p Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.

\s1 The Fall of Jerusalem Recounted
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 52:1 \xt For ver. 1-27, see 2 Kgs. 24:18–25:21\x*Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
\v 2 And he did what was evil in the sight of the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 52:2 \xt 2 Kgs. 23:37; See ch. 22:13-17\x*according to all that Jehoiakim had done.
\v 3 For because of the anger of the \nd Lord\nd* it came to the point in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence.
\p And Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
\v 4 \x + \xo 52:4 \xt For ver. 4-16, see ch. 39:1-10\x*And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and laid siege to it. And they built siegeworks all around it.
\v 5 So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
\v 6 On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.
\v 7 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king’s garden, and the Chaldeans were around the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.
\v 8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his army was scattered from him.
\v 9 Then they captured the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
\v 10 The king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and also slaughtered all the officials of Judah at \x + \xo 52:10 \xt ver. 26, 27\x*Riblah.
\v 11 \x + \xo 52:11 \xt [Ezek. 12:13]\x*He put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in chains, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison \x + \xo 52:11 \xt [Ezek. 12:13]\x*till the day of his death.
\s1 The Temple Burned
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 52:12 \xt ch. 1:3 \x*In the fifth month, on \x + \xo 52:12 \xt [2 Kgs. 25:8] \x*the tenth day of the month—that was \x + \xo 52:12 \xt [ver. 29] \x*the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon—Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard, who \x + \xo 52:12 \xt ch. 40:10\x*served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
\v 13 And he burned the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, and the king’s house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.
\v 14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem.
\v 15 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and \x + \xo 52:15 \xt See ch. 37:13\x*the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.
\v 16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.
\p
\v 17 And the \x + \xo 52:17 \xt ch. 27:19; See 2 Chr. 4:12-15 \x*pillars of bronze that were in the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, and the stands and the \x + \xo 52:17 \xt 2 Chr. 4:2, 10 \x*bronze sea that were in the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and \x + \xo 52:17 \xt See ch. 27:22\x*carried all the bronze to Babylon.
\v 18 And they took away \x + \xo 52:18 \xt 2 Kgs. 25:14\x*the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the basins and the dishes for incense and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service;
\v 19 \x + \xo 52:19 \xt 1 Kgs. 7:50; 2 Kgs. 25:15 \x*also the small bowls and the fire pans and the basins and the pots and \x + \xo 52:19 \xt 1 Kgs. 7:49 \x*the lampstands and \x + \xo 52:19 \xt Ex. 25:29; 37:16\x*the dishes for incense \x + \xo 52:19 \xt Ex. 25:29; 37:16\x*and the bowls for drink offerings. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.
\v 20 As for the two pillars, the one sea, \x + \xo 52:20 \xt 1 Kgs. 7:25, 44\x*the twelve bronze bulls that were under the sea,\f + \fr 52:20 \ft Hebrew lacks \fq the sea\f* and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the \nd Lord\nd*, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight.
\v 21 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits,\f + \fr 52:21 \ft A \fq cubit \ft was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters\f* \x + \xo 52:21 \xt 1 Kgs. 7:15\x*its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow.
\v 22 On it was a capital of bronze. The height of the one capital was \x + \xo 52:22 \xt 1 Kgs. 7:16; [2 Kgs. 25:17]\x*five cubits. A network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were around the capital. And the second pillar had the same, with pomegranates.
\v 23 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network all around.
\s1 The People Exiled to Babylon
\p
\v 24 And the captain of the guard took \x + \xo 52:24 \xt [1 Chr. 6:14, 15] \x*Seraiah the chief priest, and \x + \xo 52:24 \xt [ch. 29:25]\x*Zephaniah the second priest and the three keepers of the threshold;
\v 25 and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and \x + \xo 52:25 \xt [Esth. 1:14]\x*seven men of the king’s council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.
\v 26 And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at \x + \xo 52:26 \xt ver. 9, 10\x*Riblah.
\v 27 And the king of Babylon struck them down and put them to death at \x + \xo 52:27 \xt [See ver. 26 above]\x*Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was taken into exile out of its land.
\p
\v 28 This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: \x + \xo 52:28 \xt [2 Kgs. 24:12, 14]\x*in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans;
\v 29 \x + \xo 52:29 \xt [ver. 12]\x*in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem 832 persons;
\v 30 in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Judeans 745 persons; all the persons were 4,600.
\s1 Jehoiachin Released from Prison
\p
\v 31 \x + \xo 52:31 \xt For ver. 31-34, see 2 Kgs. 25:27-30 \x*And in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, Evil-merodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, graciously freed\f + \fr 52:31 \ft Hebrew \fq king, lifted up the head of\f* \x + \xo 52:31 \xt ch. 37:1; See ch. 22:24-30\x*Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.
\v 32 And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of \x + \xo 52:32 \xt [ch. 27:3]\x*the kings who were with him in Babylon.
\v 33 So Jehoiachin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king’s table,
\v 34 and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, according to his daily needs, until the day of his death, as long as he lived.
