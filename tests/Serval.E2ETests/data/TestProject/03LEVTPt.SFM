\v 36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things that the \nd Lord\nd* commanded by Moses.
\c 9
\s1 The \nd Lord\nd* Accepts Aaron’s Offering
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 9:1 \xt Ezek. 43:27\x*On the eighth day Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
\v 2 and he said to Aaron, \x + \xo 9:2 \xt ch. 4:3; 8:14; Ex. 29:1 \x*“Take for yourself a bull calf for a sin offering and \x + \xo 9:2 \xt ch. 8:18\x*a ram for a burnt offering, both without blemish, and offer them before the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 3 And say to the people of Israel, \x + \xo 9:3 \xt ch. 4:23; [Ezra 6:17]\x*‘Take a male goat for a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both a year old without blemish, for a burnt offering,
\v 4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the \nd Lord\nd*, and \x + \xo 9:4 \xt ver. 17; ch. 2:4 \x*a grain offering mixed with oil, for \x + \xo 9:4 \xt ver. 6, 23; Ex. 29:43\x*today the \nd Lord\nd* will appear to you.’”
\v 5 And they brought what Moses commanded in front of the tent of meeting, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 6 And Moses said, “This is the thing that the \nd Lord\nd* commanded you to do, that the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* may appear to you.”
\v 7 Then Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and \x + \xo 9:7 \xt ch. 4:3; Heb. 5:1-3; 7:27; 9:7 \x*offer your sin offering and your burnt offering and \x + \xo 9:7 \xt ch. 4:16, 20\x*make atonement for yourself and for the people, and bring the offering of the people and make atonement for them, as the \nd Lord\nd* has commanded.”
\p
\v 8 So Aaron drew near to the altar and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.
\v 9 \x + \xo 9:9 \xt ch. 4:6; 8:15 \x*And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and \x + \xo 9:9 \xt See ch. 4:7\x*put it on the horns of the altar and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.
\v 10 \x + \xo 9:10 \xt ch. 8:16 \x*But the fat and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering he burned on the altar, \x + \xo 9:10 \xt ch. 4:8\x*as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11 \xt ch. 4:11, 12; 8:17\x*The flesh and the skin he burned up with fire outside the camp.
\p
\v 12 Then he killed the burnt offering, and Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he \x + \xo 9:12 \xt ch. 1:5; 8:19\x*threw it against the sides of the altar.
\v 13 \x + \xo 9:13 \xt ch. 8:20\x*And they handed the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head, and he burned them on the altar.
\v 14 \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ch. 8:21\x*And he washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 9:15 \xt ver. 3, 7; Heb. 2:17; 5:3 \x*Then he presented the people’s offering and took the goat of the sin offering that was for the people and killed it and \x + \xo 9:15 \xt See ch. 6:26 \x*offered it as a sin offering, \x + \xo 9:15 \xt ver. 8\x*like the first one.
\v 16 And he presented the burnt offering and offered it \x + \xo 9:16 \xt ch. 1:3, 10 \x*according to the \x + \xo 9:16 \xt ch. 5:10\x*rule.
\v 17 And he presented the \x + \xo 9:17 \xt ver. 4; ch. 2:1, 2 \x*grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, \x + \xo 9:17 \xt Ex. 29:38, 39\x*besides the burnt offering of the morning.
\p
\v 18 Then he killed the ox and the ram, \x + \xo 9:18 \xt ch. 3:1, 12, 16\x*the sacrifice of peace offerings for the people. And Aaron’s sons handed him the blood, and he threw it against the sides of the altar.
\v 19 But the fat pieces of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail and that which covers \x + \xo 9:19 \xt ch. 3:3, 9, 14; 4:8; 7:3\x*the entrails and the kidneys and the long lobe of the liver—
\v 20 they put the fat pieces on the breasts, \x + \xo 9:20 \xt ch. 3:5, 16\x*and he burned the fat pieces on the altar,
\v 21 but the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved \x + \xo 9:21 \xt Ex. 29:24, 26; See ch. 7:30-34\x*for a wave offering before the \nd Lord\nd*, as Moses commanded.
\p
\v 22 Then Aaron \x + \xo 9:22 \xt [Luke 24:50] \x*lifted up his hands toward the people and \x + \xo 9:22 \xt Deut. 21:5; See Num. 6:23-27\x*blessed them, and he came down from offering the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
\v 23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and \x + \xo 9:23 \xt ver. 4, 6\x*the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* appeared to all the people.
\v 24 And \x + \xo 9:24 \xt [Judg. 6:21; 13:19, 20; 1 Kgs. 18:38; 1 Chr. 21:26; 2 Chr. 7:1] \x*fire came out from before the \nd Lord\nd* and consumed the burnt offering and the pieces of fat on the altar, and when all the people saw it, \x + \xo 9:24 \xt [Ezra 3:11] \x*they shouted and \x + \xo 9:24 \xt [1 Kgs. 18:39; 2 Chr. 7:3]\x*fell on their faces.
\c 10
\s1 The Death of Nadab and Abihu
\p \v 1 Now \x + \xo 10:1 \xt ch. 16:1; Ex. 6:23; 28:1; Num. 3:4; 26:61; 1 Chr. 24:2 \x*Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, \x + \xo 10:1 \xt [Num. 16:18] \x*each took his censer and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered \x + \xo 10:1 \xt Ex. 30:9\x*unauthorized\f + \fr 10:1 \ft Or \fq strange\f* fire before the \nd Lord\nd*, which he had not commanded them.
\v 2 And fire \x + \xo 10:2 \xt ch. 9:24; Num. 16:35; [2 Sam. 6:7]\x*came out from before the \nd Lord\nd* and consumed them, and they died before the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 3 Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the \nd Lord\nd* has said: ‘Among \x + \xo 10:3 \xt ch. 21:17, 21 \x*those who are near me \x + \xo 10:3 \xt Ezek. 28:22 \x*I will be sanctified, and before all the people I will be glorified.’” \x + \xo 10:3 \xt [Ps. 39:9]\x*And Aaron held his peace.
\p
\v 4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of \x + \xo 10:4 \xt Ex. 6:18, 22; Num. 3:19, 30\x*Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, “Come near; carry your brothers away from the front of the sanctuary and out of the camp.”
\v 5 So they came near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
\v 6 And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar his sons, \x + \xo 10:6 \xt ch. 13:45; 21:10; Ezek. 24:16, 17 \x*“Do not let the hair of your heads hang loose, and do not tear your clothes, lest you die, and \x + \xo 10:6 \xt Num. 1:53; 16:22, 46; 18:5; Josh. 7:1; 22:18, 20\x*wrath come upon all the congregation; but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning that the \nd Lord\nd* has kindled.
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7 \xt ch. 21:12 \x*And do not go outside the entrance of the tent of meeting, lest you die, \x + \xo 10:7 \xt ch. 8:30\x*for the anointing oil of the \nd Lord\nd* is upon you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.
\p
\v 8 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Aaron, saying,
\v 9 \x + \xo 10:9 \xt Ezek. 44:21; [Num. 6:3, 20; Luke 1:15; 1 Tim. 3:3, 8]\x*“Drink no wine or strong drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, lest you die. It shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.
\v 10 You are to \x + \xo 10:10 \xt ch. 11:47; 20:25; Ezek. 22:26; 44:23\x*distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean,
\v 11 and \x + \xo 10:11 \xt ch. 14:57; Deut. 24:8; Neh. 8:2, 8, 9; [Jer. 18:18; Mal. 2:7]\x*you are to teach the people of Israel all the statutes that the \nd Lord\nd* has spoken to them by Moses.”
\p
\v 12 Moses spoke to Aaron and to Eleazar and Ithamar, his surviving sons: “Take the \x + \xo 10:12 \xt ch. 6:16; Num. 18:9, 10 \x*grain offering that is left of the \nd Lord\nd*’s food offerings, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for \x + \xo 10:12 \xt See ch. 6:17\x*it is most holy.
\v 13 You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your due and your sons’ due, from the \nd Lord\nd*’s food offerings, for \x + \xo 10:13 \xt ch. 2:3; 6:16\x*so I am commanded.
\v 14 But the \x + \xo 10:14 \xt ch. 7:31, 34; Ex. 29:24, 26, 27; Num. 18:11\x*breast that is waved and the thigh that is contributed you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given as your due and your sons’ due from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the people of Israel.
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15 \xt ch. 7:31, 34\x*The thigh that is contributed and the breast that is waved they shall bring with the food offerings of the fat pieces to wave for a wave offering before the \nd Lord\nd*, and it shall be yours and your sons’ with you as a due forever, as the \nd Lord\nd* has commanded.”
\p
\v 16 Now Moses diligently inquired about \x + \xo 10:16 \xt ch. 9:3, 15\x*the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it was burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the surviving sons of Aaron, saying,
\v 17 \x + \xo 10:17 \xt ch. 6:26, 29 \x*“Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since \x + \xo 10:17 \xt [See ver. 12 above]\x*it is a thing most holy and has been given to you that you may bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the \nd Lord\nd*?
\v 18 Behold, \x + \xo 10:18 \xt ch. 6:30 \x*its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary. You certainly ought to have eaten it in the sanctuary, \x + \xo 10:18 \xt ch. 6:26\x*as I commanded.”
\v 19 And Aaron said to Moses, “Behold, \x + \xo 10:19 \xt ch. 9:8, 12 \x*today they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before the \nd Lord\nd*, and yet such things as these have happened to me! If I had eaten the sin offering today, \x + \xo 10:19 \xt Jer. 6:20; 14:12; Hos. 9:4; Mal. 1:10, 13; 2:13\x*would the \nd Lord\nd* have approved?”
\v 20 And when Moses heard that, he approved.

\v 55 And the priest shall examine the diseased thing after it has been washed. And if the appearance of the diseased area has not changed, though the disease has not spread, it is unclean. You shall burn it in the fire, whether the rot is on the back or on the front.

\v 56 “But if the priest examines, and if the diseased area has faded after it has been washed, he shall tear it out of the garment or the skin or the warp or the woof.
