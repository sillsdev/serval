\p
\v 11 In him we have obtained \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Deut. 4:20; 32:9; See ver. 14 \x*an inheritance, \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ver. 5 \x*having been predestined \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ch. 3:11; [Rev. 4:11]; See Rom. 8:28 \x*according to the purpose of him who works all things according to \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [Acts 20:27]\x*the counsel of his will,

\s1 Thanksgiving and Prayer
\p
\v 15 For this reason, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt Col. 1:4; Philem. 5; See Rom. 1:8\x*because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq your love\f* toward all the saints,

\s1 By Grace Through Faith
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Col. 2:13; [Col. 1:21] \x*And you were \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ver. 5; [ch. 4:18]; See Luke 15:24\x*dead in the trespasses and sins
\v 2 \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 4:17, 22; 5:8; Col. 3:7; See Rom. 11:30; 1 Cor. 6:11 \x*in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [ch. 6:12; Rev. 9:11]; See John 12:31 \x*the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 5:6; [1 Pet. 1:14]\x*the sons of disobedience—
\v 3 among whom we all once lived in \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Gal. 5:16 \x*the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Greek \fq flesh\f* and the mind, and \x + \xo 2:3 \xt See Ps. 51:5; Rom. 5:12 \x*were by nature \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [2 Pet. 2:14]\x*children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.\f + \fr 2:3 \ft Greek \fq like the rest\f*
\v 4 But\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Or \fq And\f* God, being \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ver. 7; Titus 3:5; See Rom. 2:4 \x*rich in mercy, \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See John 3:16\x*because of the great love with which he loved us,
\v 5 even \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ver. 1; [Rom. 5:6, 8, 10] \x*when we were dead in our trespasses, \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Col. 2:12, 13; [John 14:19; Rev. 20:4] \x*made us alive together with Christ—\x + \xo 2:5 \xt ver. 8; See Acts 15:11\x*by grace you have been saved—
\v 6 and raised us up with him and \x + \xo 2:6 \xt See ch. 1:20\x*seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
\v 7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable \x + \xo 2:7 \xt ver. 4 \x*riches of his grace in \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Titus 3:4\x*kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
\v 8 For \x + \xo 2:8 \xt ver. 5 \x*by grace you have been saved \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 1 Pet. 1:5; [Rom. 4:16] \x*through faith. And this is \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [2 Cor. 3:5] \x*not your own doing; \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [John 4:10; Heb. 6:4]\x*it is the gift of God,
\v 9 \x + \xo 2:9 \xt 2 Tim. 1:9; Titus 3:5; See Rom. 3:20, 28 \x*not a result of works, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt 1 Cor. 1:29; [Judg. 7:2]\x*so that no one may boast.
\v 10 For \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Deut. 32:6, 15; Ps. 100:3 \x*we are his workmanship, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ch. 3:9; 4:24; Col. 3:10] \x*created in Christ Jesus \x + \xo 2:10 \xt ch. 4:24 \x*for good works, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ch. 1:4] \x*which God prepared beforehand, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Col. 1:10\x*that we should walk in them.
\s1 One in Christ
\p
\v 11 Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called “the uncircumcision” by what is called \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Rom. 2:26, 28; [Col. 2:11, 13]\x*the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands—
\v 12 remember \x + \xo 2:12 \xt 1 Cor. 12:2; [ch. 5:8; Col. 3:7] \x*that you were at that time separated from Christ, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ch. 4:18; Col. 1:21; [Ezek. 14:5; Gal. 2:15; 4:8] \x*alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See Rom. 9:4 \x*the covenants of promise, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt 1 Thess. 4:13; See ch. 1:18\x*having no hope and without God in the world.
\v 13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ver. 17; Acts 2:39 \x*far off have been brought near \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Col. 1:20]; See Rom. 3:25\x*by the blood of Christ.
\v 14 For \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Ps. 72:7; Mic. 5:5; Zech. 9:10; [Col. 3:15]; See Luke 2:14 \x*he himself is our peace, \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See Gal. 3:28 \x*who has made us both one and has broken down \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Col. 1:21, 22; [Rom. 7:4]\x*in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
\v 15 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Col. 2:14, 20 \x*ordinances, that he might create in himself one \x + \xo 2:15 \xt See Rom. 6:4\x*new man in place of the two, so making peace,
\v 16 and might \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Col. 1:20-22; [1 Cor. 12:13]\x*reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
\v 17 And he came and \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Isa. 57:19 \x*preached peace to you who were \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ver. 13 \x*far off and peace to those who were \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Deut. 4:7; Ps. 148:14\x*near.
\v 18 For \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [John 14:6] \x*through him we both have \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ch. 3:12; [John 10:7, 9]; See Rom. 5:2 \x*access in \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ch. 4:4; 1 Cor. 12:13; [John 4:23]\x*one Spirit to the Father.
\v 19 So then you are no longer \x + \xo 2:19 \xt ver. 12; [Heb. 11:13; 13:14] \x*strangers and aliens,\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Or \fq sojourners\f* but you are \x + \xo 2:19 \xt Phil. 3:20; [Heb. 12:22, 23] \x*fellow citizens with the saints and \x + \xo 2:19 \xt See Gal. 6:10\x*members of the household of God,
\v 20 \x + \xo 2:20 \xt [Jer. 12:16]; See 1 Cor. 3:9 \x*built on the foundation of the \x + \xo 2:20 \xt Matt. 16:18; Rev. 21:14 \x*apostles and prophets, \x + \xo 2:20 \xt [1 Cor. 3:11] \x*Christ Jesus himself being \x + \xo 2:20 \xt Ps. 118:22; Isa. 28:16\x*the cornerstone,
\v 21 \x + \xo 2:21 \xt ch. 4:15, 16 \x*in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into \x + \xo 2:21 \xt See 1 Cor. 3:16, 17\x*a holy temple in the Lord.
\v 22 In him \x + \xo 2:22 \xt 1 Pet. 2:5 \x*you also are being built together \x + \xo 2:22 \xt [ch. 3:17; 2 Cor. 6:16; 1 Tim. 3:15]\x*into a dwelling place for God by\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Or \fq in\f* the Spirit.

\s1 The Mystery of the Gospel Revealed
\p
\v 1 For this reason I, Paul, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ch. 4:1; Acts 23:18; Phil. 1:7; [ch. 6:20] \x*a prisoner for Christ Jesus \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ver. 13; Col. 1:24\x*on behalf of you Gentiles—
\v 2 assuming that you have heard of \x + \xo 3:2 \xt ch. 1:10; Col. 1:25; 1 Tim. 1:4 \x*the stewardship of \x + \xo 3:2 \xt ver. 7; ch. 4:7; See Acts 11:23; Rom. 1:5\x*God’s grace that was given to me for you,
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Acts 22:17, 21; 26:16-18 \x*how the mystery was made known to me \x + \xo 3:3 \xt [Dan. 2:29]; See Rom. 16:25; 2 Cor. 12:1 \x*by revelation, \x + \xo 3:3 \xt [ch. 1:9, 10]\x*as I have written briefly.
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [2 Cor. 11:6] \x*When you read this, you can perceive my insight into \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Col. 4:3\x*the mystery of Christ,
\v 5 which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
\v 6 This mystery is\f + \fr 3:6 \ft The words \fq This mystery is \ft are inferred from verse 4\f* that the Gentiles are \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See Gal. 3:29 \x*fellow heirs, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ch. 2:16 \x*members of the same body, and \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ch. 5:7\x*partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Col. 1:23, 25 \x*Of this gospel I was made \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See 2 Cor. 3:6 \x*a minister according to the gift of \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See ver. 2 \x*God’s grace, which was given me \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [ver. 20]; See ch. 1:19\x*by the working of his power.
\v 8 To me, \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See 1 Cor. 15:9 \x*though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Acts 9:15 \x*to preach to the Gentiles the \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [Job 5:9; Rom. 11:33] \x*unsearchable \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See ch. 1:18; Rom. 2:4\x*riches of Christ,
\v 9 and \x + \xo 3:9 \xt See ver. 2, 3 \x*to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Col. 1:26 \x*hidden for ages in\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Or \fq by\f* God \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Rev. 4:11; [ch. 2:10]\x*who created all things,
\v 10 so that through the church the manifold \x + \xo 3:10 \xt Rom. 11:33 \x*wisdom of God \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [1 Pet. 1:12] \x*might now be made known to \x + \xo 3:10 \xt ch. 1:21; [ch. 6:12] \x*the rulers and authorities \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See ch. 1:3\x*in the heavenly places.
\v 11 This was \x + \xo 3:11 \xt See ch. 1:11\x*according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,
\v 12 in whom we have \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Heb. 4:16; 10:19 \x*boldness and \x + \xo 3:12 \xt See ch. 2:18 \x*access with \x + \xo 3:12 \xt 2 Cor. 3:4 \x*confidence through our \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Mark 11:22; Phil. 3:9\x*faith in him.
\v 13 So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering \x + \xo 3:13 \xt ver. 1 \x*for you, \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [2 Cor. 1:6]\x*which is your glory.
\s1 Prayer for Spiritual Strength
\p
\v 14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
\v 15 from whom \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See ch. 1:10, 21\x*every family\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Or \fq fatherhood\ft ; the Greek word \+tl patria\+tl* is closely related to the word for \fq Father \ft in verse 14\f* in heaven and on earth is named,

\v 17 \x + \xo 3:17 \xt [ch. 2:22] \x*so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith—that you, being \x + \xo 3:17 \xt Col. 2:7 \x*rooted and \x + \xo 3:17 \xt Col. 1:23\x*grounded in love,
\v 18 may have strength to \x + \xo 3:18 \xt [John 1:5] \x*comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and \x + \xo 3:18 \xt Rom. 8:39; [Job 11:8, 9]\x*height and depth,
\v 19 and to know the love of Christ \x + \xo 3:19 \xt [Phil. 4:7] \x*that surpasses knowledge, that \x + \xo 3:19 \xt Col. 2:10 \x*you may be filled with all \x + \xo 3:19 \xt ch. 1:23\x*the fullness of God.
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20 \xt Rom. 16:25; Jude 24 \x*Now to \x + \xo 3:20 \xt [2 Cor. 9:8] \x*him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, \x + \xo 3:20 \xt [ver. 7]\x*according to the power at work within us,
\v 21 \x + \xo 3:21 \xt See Rom. 11:36\x*to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.

\v 7 But \x + \xo 4:7 \xt See ch. 3:2 \x*grace was given \x + \xo 4:7 \xt [Matt. 25:15; 1 Cor. 12:7] \x*to each one of us \x + \xo 4:7 \xt Rom. 12:3; [ver. 16]\x*according to the measure of Christ’s gift.

\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12 \xt See 2 Cor. 13:9 \x*to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for \x + \xo 4:12 \xt ver. 16, 29 \x*building up \x + \xo 4:12 \xt See 1 Cor. 12:27\x*the body of Christ,
\v 13 until we all attain to \x + \xo 4:13 \xt [ver. 5] \x*the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Heb. 5:14 \x*to mature manhood,\f + \fr 4:13 \ft Greek \fq to a full-grown man\f* to the measure of the stature of \x + \xo 4:13 \xt ch. 1:23\x*the fullness of Christ,

\v 15 Rather, \x + \xo 4:15 \xt 1 John 3:18; [ver. 25] \x*speaking the truth in love, we are to \x + \xo 4:15 \xt ch. 2:21 \x*grow up in every way into him who is \x + \xo 4:15 \xt See ch. 1:22\x*the head, into Christ,
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16 \xt Col. 2:19 \x*from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, \x + \xo 4:16 \xt [ver. 7]\x*when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
\s1 The New Life
\p
\v 17 Now this I say and \x + \xo 4:17 \xt 1 Thess. 2:12 \x*testify in the Lord, \x + \xo 4:17 \xt ver. 22; ch. 2:1-3; Col. 3:7; 1 Pet. 4:3 \x*that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, \x + \xo 4:17 \xt Rom. 1:21; 1 Pet. 1:18; [Col. 2:18; 2 Pet. 2:18]\x*in the futility of their minds.
\v 18 They \x + \xo 4:18 \xt [Rom. 11:10] \x*are darkened in their understanding, \x + \xo 4:18 \xt See ch. 2:12 \x*alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to \x + \xo 4:18 \xt See Mark 3:5\x*their hardness of heart.
\v 19 They \x + \xo 4:19 \xt [Prov. 23:35]; 1 Tim. 4:2 \x*have become callous and \x + \xo 4:19 \xt [1 Kgs. 21:25; Rom. 1:24, 26, 28]\x*have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.
\v 20 But that is not the way you \x + \xo 4:20 \xt See Matt. 11:29\x*learned Christ!—
\v 21 assuming that \x + \xo 4:21 \xt ch. 1:13 \x*you have heard about him and \x + \xo 4:21 \xt Col. 2:7\x*were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
\v 22 to \x + \xo 4:22 \xt Col. 3:8; Heb. 12:1; James 1:21; 1 Pet. 2:1 \x*put off \x + \xo 4:22 \xt Rom. 6:6; Col. 3:9 \x*your old self,\f + \fr 4:22 \ft Greek \fq man\ft ; also verse 24\f* which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through \x + \xo 4:22 \xt [Heb. 3:13]\x*deceitful desires,
\v 23 and \x + \xo 4:23 \xt See Rom. 12:2\x*to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
\v 24 and to put on \x + \xo 4:24 \xt See Rom. 6:4 \x*the new self, \x + \xo 4:24 \xt See ch. 2:10\x*created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
\p
\v 25 Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you \x + \xo 4:25 \xt Zech. 8:16; Col. 3:9; [ver. 15] \x*speak the truth with his neighbor, for \x + \xo 4:25 \xt Rom. 12:5\x*we are members one of another.
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26 \xt [Ps. 37:8]\x*Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
\v 27 and \x + \xo 4:27 \xt See James 4:7\x*give no opportunity to the devil.
\v 28 Let the thief no longer steal, but rather \x + \xo 4:28 \xt Acts 20:35; Gal. 6:10 \x*let him labor, \x + \xo 4:28 \xt 1 Thess. 4:11; 2 Thess. 3:8, 11, 12 \x*doing honest work with his own hands, so \x + \xo 4:28 \xt [Prov. 21:26]\x*that he may have something to share with anyone in need.
\v 29 \x + \xo 4:29 \xt ch. 5:4; Col. 3:8; [Matt. 12:34] \x*Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give \x + \xo 4:29 \xt Col. 4:6; [Eccles. 10:12]\x*grace to those who hear.
\v 30 And \x + \xo 4:30 \xt Isa. 63:10; [1 Thess. 5:19] \x*do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, \x + \xo 4:30 \xt ch. 1:13 \x*by whom you were sealed for the day of \x + \xo 4:30 \xt See ch. 1:7\x*redemption.
\v 31 \x + \xo 4:31 \xt Col. 3:8, 19\x*Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32 \xt Col. 3:12, 13; 1 Pet. 3:8 \x*Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, \x + \xo 4:32 \xt [2 Cor. 2:7, 10]; See Matt. 6:14\x*forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
\c 5
\s1 Walk in Love
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 5:1 \xt [ch. 4:32; Matt. 5:7, 48; Luke 6:36]\x*Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.
\v 2 And \x + \xo 5:2 \xt Rom. 14:15; [Col. 3:14]; See John 13:34 \x*walk in love, \x + \xo 5:2 \xt See Rom. 8:37 \x*as Christ loved us and \x + \xo 5:2 \xt See Rom. 4:25 \x*gave himself up for us, a \x + \xo 5:2 \xt See Gen. 8:21 \x*fragrant \x + \xo 5:2 \xt Heb. 7:27; 9:14; 10:10, 12\x*offering and sacrifice to God.
\p
\v 3 But \x + \xo 5:3 \xt 1 Cor. 6:18; See Gal. 5:19 \x*sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness \x + \xo 5:3 \xt [ver. 12; Ps. 16:4]\x*must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.
\v 4 Let there be \x + \xo 5:4 \xt ch. 4:29; [Eccles. 10:13] \x*no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, \x + \xo 5:4 \xt [Rom. 1:28] \x*which are out of place, but instead \x + \xo 5:4 \xt ver. 20\x*let there be thanksgiving.
\v 5 For you may be sure of this, that \x + \xo 5:5 \xt See 1 Cor. 6:9 \x*everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (\x + \xo 5:5 \xt Col. 3:5\x*that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
\v 6 \x + \xo 5:6 \xt See Matt. 24:4 \x*Let no one \x + \xo 5:6 \xt Col. 2:8 \x*deceive you with empty words, for because of these things \x + \xo 5:6 \xt Rom. 1:18; Col. 3:6 \x*the wrath of God comes upon \x + \xo 5:6 \xt ch. 2:2; [1 Pet. 1:14]\x*the sons of disobedience.
\v 7 Therefore \x + \xo 5:7 \xt ch. 3:6\x*do not become partners with them;
\v 8 for \x + \xo 5:8 \xt See ch. 2:1, 2 \x*at one time you were \x + \xo 5:8 \xt See Acts 26:18 \x*darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Isa. 2:5; See Luke 16:8; John 12:35, 36\x*Walk as children of light
\v 9 (for \x + \xo 5:9 \xt [Gal. 5:22]; See Rom. 7:4\x*the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true),
\v 10 and \x + \xo 5:10 \xt 1 Thess. 2:4; 5:21\x*try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
\v 11 \x + \xo 5:11 \xt See 1 Cor. 5:9 \x*Take no part in the \x + \xo 5:11 \xt Rom. 6:21 \x*unfruitful \x + \xo 5:11 \xt Rom. 13:12 \x*works of darkness, but instead \x + \xo 5:11 \xt Lev. 19:17; 1 Tim. 5:20\x*expose them.
\v 12 For \x + \xo 5:12 \xt [ver. 3]\x*it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret.
\v 13 But when \x + \xo 5:13 \xt John 3:20, 21; [ver. 9]\x*anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible,
\v 14 for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 5:14 \xt [Isa. 51:17; 52:1; 60:1; Mal. 4:2]; See Rom. 13:11 \x*“Awake, O sleeper,
\q2 and \x + \xo 5:14 \xt Isa. 26:19 \x*arise from the dead,
\q1 and \x + \xo 5:14 \xt Luke 1:78, 79\x*Christ will shine on you.”
\b
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 5:15 \xt Col. 4:5; [Prov. 15:21]\x*Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
\v 16 \x + \xo 5:16 \xt [See ver. 15 above] \x*making the best use of the time, because \x + \xo 5:16 \xt ch. 6:13; Eccles. 12:1; Amos 5:13; Gal. 1:4\x*the days are evil.
\v 17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what \x + \xo 5:17 \xt Rom. 12:2; 1 Thess. 4:3; 5:18\x*the will of the Lord is.
\v 18 And \x + \xo 5:18 \xt Prov. 20:1; 23:20, 31; 1 Cor. 5:11 \x*do not get drunk with wine, for that is \x + \xo 5:18 \xt Titus 1:6; 1 Pet. 4:4 \x*debauchery, but \x + \xo 5:18 \xt [Luke 1:15]\x*be filled with the Spirit,
\v 19 addressing one another in \x + \xo 5:19 \xt Acts 16:25; 1 Cor. 14:26; Col. 3:16; James 5:13\x*psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart,
\v 20 \x + \xo 5:20 \xt Col. 3:17; 1 Thess. 1:2; 2 Thess. 1:3 \x*giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father \x + \xo 5:20 \xt Heb. 13:15; [John 14:13]\x*in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 21 \x + \xo 5:21 \xt [Phil. 2:3]\x*submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
\s1 Wives and Husbands
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 5:22 \xt For ch. 5:22–6:9, see Col. 3:18–4:1 \x*Wives, \x + \xo 5:22 \xt See Gen. 3:16 \x*submit to your own husbands, \x + \xo 5:22 \xt [ch. 6:5]\x*as to the Lord.
\v 23 For \x + \xo 5:23 \xt 1 Cor. 11:3 \x*the husband is the head of the wife even as \x + \xo 5:23 \xt See ch. 1:22, 23 \x*Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is \x + \xo 5:23 \xt [1 Cor. 6:13]\x*himself its Savior.
\v 24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit \x + \xo 5:24 \xt [Col. 3:20, 22; Titus 2:9]\x*in everything to their husbands.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 5:25 \xt ver. 28, 33; [1 Pet. 3:7] \x*Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and \x + \xo 5:25 \xt ver. 2\x*gave himself up for her,
\v 26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by \x + \xo 5:26 \xt Titus 3:5; [Rev. 7:14] \x*the washing of water \x + \xo 5:26 \xt ch. 6:17; Heb. 6:5; See John 15:3\x*with the word,
\v 27 so \x + \xo 5:27 \xt 2 Cor. 11:2; See ch. 1:4 \x*that he might present the church to himself in splendor, \x + \xo 5:27 \xt Song 4:7\x*without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.\f + \fr 5:27 \ft Or \fq holy and blameless\f*
\v 28 In the same way \x + \xo 5:28 \xt ver. 25, 33\x*husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
\v 29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,
\v 30 because \x + \xo 5:30 \xt [Gen. 2:23]; See 1 Cor. 6:15\x*we are members of his body.
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31 \xt Matt. 19:5; Mark 10:7, 8; Cited from Gen. 2:24 \x*“Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and \x + \xo 5:31 \xt 1 Cor. 6:16\x*the two shall become one flesh.”
\v 32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
\v 33 However, \x + \xo 5:33 \xt ver. 25, 28 \x*let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she \x + \xo 5:33 \xt 1 Pet. 3:2, 6\x*respects her husband.
\c 6
\s1 Children and Parents
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 6:1 \xt Prov. 1:8; 6:20; 23:22\x*Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
\v 2 \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Cited from Ex. 20:12\x*“Honor your father and mother” (this is the first commandment with a promise),
\v 3 “that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land.”
\v 4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, \x + \xo 6:4 \xt Gen. 18:19; Deut. 4:9; 6:7; 11:19; Ps. 78:4; Prov. 19:18; 22:6; 29:17; [2 Tim. 3:15]\x*but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
\s1 Bondservants and Masters
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 6:5 \xt See 1 Pet. 2:18 \x*Bondservants,\f + \fr 6:5 \ft Or \fq slaves\ft ; also verse 6 (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* obey your earthly masters\f + \fr 6:5 \ft Or \fq your masters according to the flesh\f* with fear and trembling, \x + \xo 6:5 \xt [2 Cor. 11:3] \x*with a sincere heart, \x + \xo 6:5 \xt [ch. 5:22]\x*as you would Christ,
\v 6 not by the way of eye-service, as \x + \xo 6:6 \xt See Gal. 1:10\x*people-pleasers, but as bondservants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,
\v 7 rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man,
\v 8 \x + \xo 6:8 \xt See Ps. 62:12 \x*knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, \x + \xo 6:8 \xt Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11\x*whether he is a bondservant\f + \fr 6:8 \ft Or \fq slave \ft (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* or is free.
\v 9 Masters, do the same to them, \x + \xo 6:9 \xt Lev. 25:43 \x*and stop your threatening, knowing that \x + \xo 6:9 \xt John 13:13; [Job 31:13-15] \x*he who is both their Master\f + \fr 6:9 \ft Greek \fq Lord\f* and yours is in heaven, and that \x + \xo 6:9 \xt See Deut. 10:17\x*there is no partiality with him.
\s1 The Whole Armor of God
\p
\v 10 Finally, \x + \xo 6:10 \xt Rom. 4:20 (Gk.); 2 Tim. 2:1; [1 John 2:14]; See ch. 3:16 \x*be strong in the Lord and in \x + \xo 6:10 \xt ch. 1:19\x*the strength of his might.
\v 11 \x + \xo 6:11 \xt ver. 14; Job 29:14; See Rom. 13:12 \x*Put on \x + \xo 6:11 \xt ver. 13; [2 Cor. 10:4] \x*the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against \x + \xo 6:11 \xt ch. 4:14\x*the schemes of the devil.
\v 12 For \x + \xo 6:12 \xt See 1 Cor. 9:25 \x*we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against \x + \xo 6:12 \xt ch. 1:21 \x*the rulers, against the authorities, against \x + \xo 6:12 \xt See ch. 2:2 \x*the cosmic powers over \x + \xo 6:12 \xt Luke 22:53; Col. 1:13 \x*this present darkness, against \x + \xo 6:12 \xt [ch. 3:10] \x*the spiritual forces of evil \x + \xo 6:12 \xt See ch. 1:3\x*in the heavenly places.
\v 13 Therefore \x + \xo 6:13 \xt [1 Pet. 4:1] \x*take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in \x + \xo 6:13 \xt ch. 5:16\x*the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.
\v 14 Stand therefore, \x + \xo 6:14 \xt 1 Pet. 1:13; [Isa. 11:5]; See Luke 12:35 \x*having fastened on the belt of truth, and \x + \xo 6:14 \xt Isa. 59:17; 1 Thess. 5:8; [Isa. 61:10; 2 Cor. 6:7]\x*having put on the breastplate of righteousness,

\v 16 In all circumstances take up \x + \xo 6:16 \xt [1 John 5:4] \x*the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all \x + \xo 6:16 \xt [Ps. 120:4] \x*the flaming darts of \x + \xo 6:16 \xt See Matt. 13:19\x*the evil one;
\v 17 and take \x + \xo 6:17 \xt [See ver. 14 above] \x*the helmet of salvation, and \x + \xo 6:17 \xt Heb. 4:12; [Isa. 49:2; Hos. 6:5; 2 Cor. 6:7]\x*the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
\v 18 praying \x + \xo 6:18 \xt Luke 18:1 \x*at all times \x + \xo 6:18 \xt Jude 20; See Rom. 8:26 \x*in the Spirit, \x + \xo 6:18 \xt Col. 4:2-4 \x*with all prayer and supplication.

\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 6:23 \xt Gal. 6:16; 2 Thess. 3:16; 1 Pet. 5:14 \x*Peace be to the brothers,\f + \fr 6:23 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* and \x + \xo 6:23 \xt [Gal. 5:6; 1 Thess. 5:8]\x*love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
