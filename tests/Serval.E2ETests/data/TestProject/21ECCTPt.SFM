\s1 All Is Vanity
\p
\v 1 The words of \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ver. 12; ch. 7:27; 12:8-10 \x*the Preacher,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or \fq Convener\ft , or \fq Collector\ft ; Hebrew \+tl Qoheleth\+tl* (so throughout Ecclesiastes)\f* the son of David, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt ver. 12\x*king in Jerusalem.
\b
\q1
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 12:8 \x*Vanity\f + \fr 1:2 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl*, translated \fq vanity \ft or \fq vain\ft , refers concretely to a “mist,” “vapor,” or “mere breath,” and metaphorically to something that is fleeting or elusive (with different nuances depending on the context). It appears five times in this verse and in 29 other verses in Ecclesiastes\f* of vanities, says \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [See ver. 1 above] \x*the Preacher,
\q2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 12:8 \x*vanity of vanities! \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [Rom. 8:20]\x*All is vanity.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ver. 14; Ps. 144:4; See Job 7:16; Ps. 39:5 \x*What \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ch. 2:11, 22; 3:9; 5:16\x*does man gain by all the toil
\q2 at which he toils under the sun?
\q1
\v 4 A generation goes, and a generation comes,
\q2 but \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Ps. 104:5; 119:90\x*the earth remains forever.
\q1
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [Ps. 19:4-6]\x*The sun rises, and the sun goes down,
\q2 and hastens\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or \fq and returns panting\f* to the place where it rises.
\q1
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [ch. 11:5; John 3:8]\x*The wind blows to the south
\q2 and goes around to the north;
\q1 around and around goes the wind,
\q2 and on its circuits the wind returns.
\q1
\v 7 All \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Ps. 104:8, 9\x*streams run to the sea,
\q2 but the sea is not full;
\q1 to the place where the streams flow,
\q2 there they flow again.
\q1
\v 8 All things are full of weariness;
\q2 a man cannot utter it;
\q1 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ch. 4:8; Prov. 27:20\x*the eye is not satisfied with seeing,
\q2 nor the ear filled with hearing.
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ch. 3:15; 6:10; [ch. 2:12]\x*What has been is what will be,
\q2 and what has been done is what will be done,
\q2 and there is nothing new under the sun.
\q1
\v 10 Is there a thing of which it is said,
\q2 “See, this is new”?
\q1 It has been \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 3:15\x*already
\q2 in the ages before us.
\q1
\v 11 There is no \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ch. 2:16; See ch. 9:5\x*remembrance of former things,\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or \fq former people\f*
\q2 nor will there be any remembrance
\q1 of later things\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Or \fq later people\f* yet to be
\q2 among those who come after.
\s1 The Vanity of Wisdom
\p
\v 12 I \x + \xo 1:12 \xt ver. 1\x*the Preacher have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
\v 13 And I \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ver. 17; [1 Kgs. 4:33] \x*applied my heart\f + \fr 1:13 \ft The Hebrew term denotes the center of one’s inner life, including mind, will, and emotions\f* to seek and to search out by wisdom all that is done under heaven. It is an unhappy \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 2:23, 26; 3:10; [Gen. 3:19]\x*business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
\v 14 I have seen everything that is done under the sun, and behold, all is \x + \xo 1:14 \xt ver. 2; ch. 2:11, 17, 26; 4:4; 6:9\x*vanity\f + \fr 1:14 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath” (see note on 1:2)\f* and a striving after wind.\f + \fr 1:14 \ft Or \fq a feeding on wind\ft ; compare Hosea 12:1 (also in Ecclesiastes 1:17; 2:11, 17, 26; 4:4, 6, 16; 6:9)\f*
\b
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt See ch. 7:13\x*What is crooked cannot be made straight,
\q2 and what is lacking cannot be counted.
\b
\p
\v 16 I said in my heart, “I have acquired great \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 2:9; [1 Kgs. 3:12, 13; 4:30; 10:7, 23]\x*wisdom, surpassing all who were over Jerusalem before me, and my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”
\v 17 And I \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ver. 13; [ch. 2:3, 12; 7:23, 25] \x*applied my heart to know wisdom and to know \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 9:3 \x*madness and folly. I perceived that this also is but \x + \xo 1:17 \xt [See ver. 14 above]\x*a striving after wind.
\b
\q1
\v 18 For \x + \xo 1:18 \xt [ch. 12:12]\x*in much wisdom is much vexation,
\q2 and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.
\c 2
\s1 The Vanity of Self-Indulgence
\p
\v 1 I \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Luke 12:19\x*said in my heart, “Come now, I will test you with pleasure; enjoy yourself.” But behold, this also was vanity.\f + \fr 2:1 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath”; also verses 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 26 (see note on 1:2)\f*
\v 2 I \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [Prov. 14:13]\x*said of laughter, “It is mad,” and of pleasure, “What use is it?”
\v 3 I \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [ch. 1:17] \x*searched with my heart how to cheer my body with wine—my heart still guiding me with wisdom—and how to lay hold on \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 7:25\x*folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven during the few days of their life.
\v 4 I made great works. I \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See 1 Kgs. 7:1-12 \x*built houses and planted \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Song 8:11\x*vineyards for myself.
\v 5 I made myself \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Song 4:16; 5:1\x*gardens and parks, and planted in them all kinds of fruit trees.
\v 6 I made myself pools from which to water the forest of growing trees.
\v 7 I bought male and female slaves, and had \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Gen. 14:14; 15:3 \x*slaves who were born in my house. I had also great possessions of \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [1 Kgs. 4:23]\x*herds and flocks, more than any who had been before me in Jerusalem.
\v 8 I also gathered for myself silver and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 1 Kgs. 9:28; 10:10, 14, 21 \x*gold and the treasure of \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [1 Kgs. 4:21; 10:15] \x*kings and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 1 Kgs. 20:14; Ezek. 19:8 \x*provinces. I got \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 2 Sam. 19:35; 2 Chr. 35:25 \x*singers, both men and women, and many \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 1 Kgs. 11:3\x*concubines,\f + \fr 2:8 \ft The meaning of the Hebrew word is uncertain\f* the delight of the sons of man.
\p
\v 9 So I became great and \x + \xo 2:9 \xt 1 Chr. 29:25; See ch. 1:16\x*surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my \x + \xo 2:9 \xt 1 Chr. 29:25; See ch. 1:16\x*wisdom remained with me.
\v 10 And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [Prov. 8:31] \x*found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my \x + \xo 2:10 \xt ch. 3:22; 5:18; 9:9\x*reward for all my toil.
\v 11 Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was \x + \xo 2:11 \xt See ch. 1:14 \x*vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing \x + \xo 2:11 \xt See ch. 1:3\x*to be gained under the sun.
\s1 The Vanity of Living Wisely
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ch. 7:25 \x*So I turned to consider \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See ch. 1:17 \x*wisdom and madness and folly. For what can the man do who comes after the king? Only \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ch. 1:9, 10\x*what has already been done.
\v 13 Then I saw that there is more gain in wisdom than in folly, as there is more gain in light than in darkness.
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Prov. 17:24] \x*The wise person has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness. And yet I perceived that the \x + \xo 2:14 \xt ch. 3:19; 9:2, 3; Ps. 49:10\x*same event happens to all of them.
\v 15 Then I said in my heart, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [ver. 16; ch. 6:8]\x*“What happens to the fool will happen to me also. Why then have I been so very wise?” And I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
\v 16 For of the wise as of the fool there is \x + \xo 2:16 \xt ch. 1:11; See ch. 9:5 \x*no enduring remembrance, seeing that in the days to come all will have been long forgotten. \x + \xo 2:16 \xt See ver. 14\x*How the wise dies just like the fool!
\v 17 So I hated life, because what is done under the sun was grievous to me, for \x + \xo 2:17 \xt [See ver. 11 above]\x*all is vanity and a striving after wind.
\s1 The Vanity of Toil
\p
\v 18 I hated \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ch. 1:3 \x*all my toil in which I toil under the sun, seeing that I must \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Ps. 39:6; 49:10\x*leave it to the man who will come after me,
\v 19 and who knows whether he will be wise or a fool? Yet he will be master of all for which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun. This also is vanity.
\v 20 So I \x + \xo 2:20 \xt ch. 7:25 \x*turned about and gave my heart up to despair \x + \xo 2:20 \xt ch. 1:3\x*over all the toil of my labors under the sun,
\v 21 because sometimes a person who has toiled with wisdom and knowledge and skill must leave everything to be enjoyed by someone who did not toil for it. This also is vanity and a great evil.
\v 22 What has a man from \x + \xo 2:22 \xt See ch. 1:3\x*all the toil and striving of heart with which he toils beneath the sun?
\v 23 For \x + \xo 2:23 \xt Job 5:7; 14:1 \x*all his days are full of sorrow, and his \x + \xo 2:23 \xt See ch. 1:13\x*work is a vexation. Even in the night his heart does not rest. This also is vanity.
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24 \xt ch. 3:12, 13, 22; 5:18; 8:15; [1 Tim. 6:17] \x*There is nothing better for a person than that he should \x + \xo 2:24 \xt [ch. 9:7; Luke 12:19; 1 Cor. 15:32] \x*eat and drink and find enjoyment\f + \fr 2:24 \ft Or \fq and make his soul see good\f* in his toil. This also, I saw, is \x + \xo 2:24 \xt [ch. 3:13; 5:19]\x*from the hand of God,
\v 25 for apart from him\f + \fr 2:25 \ft Some Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Syriac; most Hebrew manuscripts \fq apart from me\f* who can eat or who can have enjoyment?
\v 26 For to the one who pleases him \x + \xo 2:26 \xt Job 32:8 \x*God has given wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he has given \x + \xo 2:26 \xt [See ver. 7 above] \x*the business of gathering and collecting, \x + \xo 2:26 \xt [Job 27:16, 17; Prov. 13:22] \x*only to give to one who pleases God. \x + \xo 2:26 \xt See ch. 1:14\x*This also is vanity and a striving after wind.
\c 3
\s1 A Time for Everything
\p
\v 1 For everything there is a season, and \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ver. 17; ch. 8:6\x*a time for every matter under heaven:
\b
\q1
\v 2 a time to be born, and a time to \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Heb. 9:27\x*die;
\q1 a time to plant, and a time to pluck up what is planted;
\q1
\v 3 a time to kill, and a time to heal;
\q1 a time to break down, and a time to build up;
\q1
\v 4 a time to \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [Rom. 12:15] \x*weep, and a time to laugh;
\q1 a time to mourn, and a time to \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [2 Sam. 6:14]; See Ex. 15:20\x*dance;
\q1
\v 5 a time to \x + \xo 3:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 3:25] \x*cast away stones, and a time to \x + \xo 3:5 \xt [Isa. 5:2] \x*gather stones together;
\q1 a time to embrace, and a time to \x + \xo 3:5 \xt [Joel 2:16]\x*refrain from embracing;
\q1
\v 6 a time to seek, and a time to \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [Matt. 10:39] \x*lose;
\q1 a time to keep, and a time to \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [Prov. 11:24]\x*cast away;
\q1
\v 7 a time to \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See Gen. 37:29 \x*tear, and a time to sew;
\q1 a time to \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Amos 5:13\x*keep silence, and a time to speak;
\q1
\v 8 a time to love, and a time to \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [Luke 14:26]\x*hate;
\q1 a time for war, and a time for peace.
\s1 The God-Given Task
\p
\v 9 What \x + \xo 3:9 \xt See ch. 1:3\x*gain has the worker from his toil?
\v 10 I have seen \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See ch. 1:13 \x*the business that \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See Gen. 3:17-19\x*God has given to the children of man to be busy with.
\v 11 He has \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [Gen. 1:31] \x*made everything beautiful in its time. Also, he has put eternity into man’s heart, yet so that he cannot \x + \xo 3:11 \xt ch. 8:17; [Job 5:9; Rom. 11:33]\x*find out what God has done from the beginning to the end.
\v 12 I perceived that there is \x + \xo 3:12 \xt [ver. 22] \x*nothing better for them than to be joyful and to \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Ps. 34:14; 37:3\x*do good as long as they live;
\v 13 also \x + \xo 3:13 \xt See ch. 2:24 \x*that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil—this is \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [ch. 2:24; 5:19]\x*God’s gift to man.
\p
\v 14 I perceived that whatever God does endures forever; \x + \xo 3:14 \xt [James 1:17]\x*nothing can be added to it, nor anything taken from it. God has done it, so that people fear before him.
\v 15 That which is, \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [ch. 1:9] \x*already has been; that which is to be, already has been; and God \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [ch. 12:14]\x*seeks what has been driven away.\f + \fr 3:15 \ft Hebrew \fq what has been pursued\f*
\s1 From Dust to Dust
\p
\v 16 Moreover, \x + \xo 3:16 \xt ch. 4:1 \x*I saw under the sun that in the place of justice, even \x + \xo 3:16 \xt ch. 5:8; [ch. 4:1]\x*there was wickedness, and in the place of righteousness, even there was wickedness.
\v 17 I said in my heart, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt Matt. 16:27; 2 Cor. 5:10; See Rom. 2:6-11; 2 Thess. 1:6-10 \x*God will judge the righteous and the wicked, for there is \x + \xo 3:17 \xt ver. 1; ch. 8:6\x*a time for every matter and for every work.
\v 18 I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but \x + \xo 3:18 \xt Ps. 49:12, 20; 73:22\x*beasts.
\v 19 \x + \xo 3:19 \xt See ch. 2:14\x*For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity.\f + \fr 3:19 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath” (see note on 1:2)\f*
\v 20 All go to one place. All are from \x + \xo 3:20 \xt ch. 12:7; Gen. 3:19\x*the dust, and to dust all return.
\v 21 Who knows whether \x + \xo 3:21 \xt [ch. 12:7]\x*the spirit of man goes upward and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?
\v 22 So I saw that there is \x + \xo 3:22 \xt See ch. 2:24 \x*nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for \x + \xo 3:22 \xt See ch. 2:10 \x*that is his lot. Who can bring him to see \x + \xo 3:22 \xt ch. 2:19; 6:12; 8:7; 10:14\x*what will be after him?
\c 4
\s1 Evil Under the Sun
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 9:11 \x*Again I \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 3:16 \x*saw all \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 5:8; Job 35:9 \x*the oppressions that are done under the sun. And behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had \x + \xo 4:1 \xt Lam. 1:2\x*no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power, and there was no one to comfort them.
\v 2 And I \x + \xo 4:2 \xt See Job 3:11-26\x*thought the dead who are already dead more fortunate than the living who are still alive.
\v 3 But \x + \xo 4:3 \xt ch. 6:3\x*better than both is he who has not yet been and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.
\p
\v 4 Then I saw that all toil and all skill in work come from a man’s envy of his neighbor. This also is \x + \xo 4:4 \xt See ch. 1:14\x*vanity\f + \fr 4:4 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath”; also verses 7, 8, 16 (see note on 1:2)\f* and a striving after wind.
\p
\v 5 The fool \x + \xo 4:5 \xt Prov. 6:10; 24:33 \x*folds his hands and \x + \xo 4:5 \xt [Isa. 9:20]\x*eats his own flesh.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 4:6 \xt See Prov. 15:16 \x*Better is a handful of \x + \xo 4:6 \xt ch. 6:5\x*quietness than two hands full of toil and a striving after wind.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7 \xt [See ver. 1 above]\x*Again, I saw vanity under the sun:
\v 8 one person who has no other, either son or brother, yet there is no end to all his toil, and his \x + \xo 4:8 \xt ch. 1:8; [Prov. 27:20; 1 John 2:16] \x*eyes are never satisfied with riches, so that he never asks, \x + \xo 4:8 \xt ch. 2:18; Ps. 39:6 \x*“For whom am I toiling and depriving myself of pleasure?” This also is vanity and an unhappy \x + \xo 4:8 \xt See ch. 1:13\x*business.
\p
\v 9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil.
\v 10 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up!
\v 11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, \x + \xo 4:11 \xt See 1 Kgs. 1:1-4\x*but how can one keep warm alone?
\v 12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him—a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
\p
\v 13 Better was \x + \xo 4:13 \xt [ch. 9:15, 16] \x*a poor and wise youth than an old and foolish king who no longer knew how \x + \xo 4:13 \xt [Prov. 12:15]\x*to take advice.
\v 14 For he went \x + \xo 4:14 \xt See Gen. 41:14, 41-43\x*from prison to the throne, though in his own kingdom he had been born poor.
\v 15 I saw all the living who move about under the sun, along with that\f + \fr 4:15 \ft Hebrew \fq the second\f* youth who was to stand in the king’s\f + \fr 4:15 \ft Hebrew \fq his\f* place.
\v 16 There was no end of all the people, all of whom he led. Yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. Surely this also is \x + \xo 4:16 \xt See ch. 1:14\x*vanity and a striving after wind.
\c 5
\s1 Fear God
\p
\v 1 \f + \fr 5:1 \ft Ch 4:17 in Hebrew\f* \x + \xo 5:1 \xt [Ex. 3:5; Isa. 1:12] \x*Guard your steps when you go to \x + \xo 5:1 \xt [Gen. 28:17] \x*the house of God. To draw near to listen is better than to \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Prov. 15:8; See 1 Sam. 15:22\x*offer the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know that they are doing evil.
\v 2 \f + \fr 5:2 \ft Ch 5:1 in Hebrew\f* Be not rash with your mouth, nor let your heart be hasty to utter a word before God, for God is in heaven and you are on earth. Therefore \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [Matt. 6:7]\x*let your words be few.
\v 3 For a dream comes with much business, and a fool’s voice with \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Prov. 10:19; [Job 11:2]\x*many words.
\p
\v 4 When \x + \xo 5:4 \xt Num. 30:2 \x*you vow a vow to God, \x + \xo 5:4 \xt Deut. 23:21; Ps. 50:14; 76:11 \x*do not delay paying it, for he has no pleasure in fools. \x + \xo 5:4 \xt [Ps. 66:13, 14]\x*Pay what you vow.
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [Prov. 20:25; Acts 5:4]\x*It is better that you should not vow than that you should vow and not pay.
\v 6 Let not your mouth lead you\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Hebrew \fq your flesh\f* into sin, and do not say before \x + \xo 5:6 \xt [1 Cor. 11:10] \x*the messenger\f + \fr 5:6 \ft Or \fq angel\f* that it was \x + \xo 5:6 \xt ch. 10:5; Num. 15:25, 26\x*a mistake. Why should God be angry at your voice and destroy the work of your hands?
\v 7 For when dreams increase and words grow many, there is vanity;\f + \fr 5:7 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath”; also verse 10 (see note on 1:2)\f* but\f + \fr 5:7 \ft Or \fq For when dreams and vanities increase, words also grow many; but\f* \x + \xo 5:7 \xt ch. 12:13\x*God is the one you must fear.
\s1 The Vanity of Wealth and Honor

\v 8 \x + \xo 5:8 \xt ch. 3:16; 4:1 \x*If you see in a province the oppression of the poor and the violation of justice and righteousness, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt [1 Pet. 4:12] \x*do not be amazed at the matter, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt [Ps. 12:5; 58:11; 82:1]\x*for the high official is watched by a higher, and there are yet higher ones over them.
\v 9 But this is gain for a land in every way: a king committed to cultivated fields.\f + \fr 5:9 \ft The meaning of the Hebrew verse is uncertain\f*
\p
\v 10 He who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income; this also is vanity.
\v 11 When goods increase, they increase who eat them, and what advantage has their owner but to see them with his eyes?
\v 12 Sweet is the sleep of a laborer, whether he eats little or much, but the full stomach of the rich will not let him sleep.
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 5:13 \xt ch. 6:1\x*There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches were kept by their owner to his hurt,
\v 14 and those riches were lost in a bad venture. And he is father of a son, but he has nothing in his hand.
\v 15 \x + \xo 5:15 \xt See Job 1:21\x*As he came from his mother’s womb he shall go again, naked as he came, and shall take nothing for his toil that he may carry away in his hand.
\v 16 This also is a grievous evil: just as he came, so shall he go, and what \x + \xo 5:16 \xt See ch. 1:3 \x*gain is there to him who \x + \xo 5:16 \xt [Prov. 11:29]\x*toils for the wind?
\v 17 Moreover, all his days he \x + \xo 5:17 \xt [Ps. 127:2]\x*eats in darkness in much vexation and sickness and anger.
\p
\v 18 Behold, what I have seen to be \x + \xo 5:18 \xt See ch. 2:24 \x*good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment\f + \fr 5:18 \ft Or \fq and see good\f* in all the toil with which one toils under the sun the few days of his life that God has given him, for this is his \x + \xo 5:18 \xt See ch. 2:10\x*lot.
\v 19 Everyone also to whom \x + \xo 5:19 \xt ch. 6:2; [ch. 2:24] \x*God has given \x + \xo 5:19 \xt 2 Chr. 1:11 \x*wealth and possessions \x + \xo 5:19 \xt [ch. 6:2] \x*and power to enjoy them, and to accept his lot and rejoice in his toil—this is \x + \xo 5:19 \xt See ch. 3:13\x*the gift of God.
\v 20 For he will not much remember the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with joy in his heart.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 5:13\x*There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, and it lies heavy on mankind:
\v 2 a man \x + \xo 6:2 \xt ch. 5:19 \x*to whom \x + \xo 6:2 \xt [1 Kgs. 3:13] \x*God gives wealth, possessions, and honor, so that he \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Ps. 17:14; 73:7; See Job 21:7-13 \x*lacks nothing of all that he desires, yet God \x + \xo 6:2 \xt [ch. 5:19; Luke 12:20]\x*does not give him power to enjoy them, but a stranger enjoys them. This is vanity;\f + \fr 6:2 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath”; also verses 4, 9, 11 (see note on 1:2)\f* it is a grievous evil.
\v 3 If a man fathers a hundred children and lives many years, so that \x + \xo 6:3 \xt Gen. 47:8, 9 \x*the days of his years are many, but his soul is not satisfied with life’s \x + \xo 6:3 \xt [ver. 6] \x*good things, and he also has no \x + \xo 6:3 \xt Isa. 14:20; Jer. 8:2; 22:19; [2 Kgs. 9:35] \x*burial, I say that \x + \xo 6:3 \xt ch. 4:3; Job 3:16\x*a stillborn child is better off than he.
\v 4 For it comes in vanity and goes in darkness, and in darkness its name is covered.
\v 5 Moreover, it has not \x + \xo 6:5 \xt ch. 7:11; 11:7 \x*seen the sun or known anything, yet it finds \x + \xo 6:5 \xt ch. 4:6\x*rest rather than he.
\v 6 Even though he should live a thousand years twice over, yet enjoy\f + \fr 6:6 \ft Or \fq see\f* no good—do not all go to the one place?
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 6:7 \xt [Prov. 16:26]\x*All the toil of man is for his mouth, yet his appetite is not satisfied.\f + \fr 6:7 \ft Hebrew \fq filled\f*
\v 8 For what advantage has the wise man \x + \xo 6:8 \xt [ch. 2:15]\x*over the fool? And what does the poor man have who knows how to conduct himself before the living?
\v 9 Better \x + \xo 6:9 \xt ch. 11:9 \x*is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the appetite: this also is \x + \xo 6:9 \xt See ch. 1:14\x*vanity and a striving after wind.
\p
\v 10 Whatever has come to be has \x + \xo 6:10 \xt ch. 1:10; 3:15 \x*already been named, and it is known what man is, and that he is not able to \x + \xo 6:10 \xt Job 9:32; Isa. 45:9; [1 Cor. 10:22]\x*dispute with one stronger than he.
\v 11 The more words, the more vanity, and what is the advantage to man?
\v 12 For who knows what is good for man while he lives the few days of his \x + \xo 6:12 \xt [ch. 7:15; 9:9] \x*vain\f + \fr 6:12 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath” (see note on 1:2)\f* life, which he passes like \x + \xo 6:12 \xt ch. 8:13; See Job 14:2 \x*a shadow? For who can tell man what will be \x + \xo 6:12 \xt [ch. 2:18; 3:22]\x*after him under the sun?

\s1 The Contrast of Wisdom and Folly
\q1
\v 1 \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Prov. 22:1; [Song 1:3] \x*A good name is better than precious ointment,
\q2 and \x + \xo 7:1 \xt ch. 4:2\x*the day of death than the day of birth.
\q1
\v 2 It is better to go to the house of mourning
\q2 than to go to the house of feasting,
\q1 for this is the end of all mankind,
\q2 and the living will \x + \xo 7:2 \xt [Ps. 90:12]\x*lay it to heart.
\q1
\v 3 Sorrow is better than laughter,
\q2 \x + \xo 7:3 \xt [2 Cor. 7:10]\x*for by sadness of face the heart is made glad.
\q1
\v 4 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
\q2 but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
\q1
\v 5 It is \x + \xo 7:5 \xt Prov. 13:18; 15:31, 32; [Ps. 141:5]\x*better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise
\q2 than to hear the song of fools.
\q1
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6 \xt [Joel 2:5] \x*For as the crackling of \x + \xo 7:6 \xt [Ps. 58:9; 118:12]\x*thorns under a pot,
\q2 so is the laughter of the fools;
\q2 this also is vanity.\f + \fr 7:6 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath” (see note on 1:2)\f*
\q1
\v 7 Surely \x + \xo 7:7 \xt [ch. 4:1] \x*oppression drives the wise into madness,
\q2 and \x + \xo 7:7 \xt Deut. 16:19; See Prov. 17:8\x*a bribe corrupts the heart.
\q1
\v 8 Better is the end of a thing than its beginning,
\q2 and \x + \xo 7:8 \xt See Prov. 14:29\x*the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9 \xt [Prov. 14:17; 16:32; James 1:19] \x*Be not quick in your spirit to become angry,
\q2 \x + \xo 7:9 \xt [Eph. 4:26]\x*for anger lodges in the heart\f + \fr 7:9 \ft Hebrew \fq in the bosom\f* of fools.
\q1
\v 10 Say not, “Why were the former days better than these?”
\q2 For it is not from wisdom that you ask this.
\q1
\v 11 Wisdom is good with an inheritance,
\q2 an advantage to those who \x + \xo 7:11 \xt ch. 6:5; 11:7\x*see the sun.
\q1
\v 12 For the protection of wisdom is like \x + \xo 7:12 \xt [ch. 10:19] \x*the protection of money,
\q2 and the advantage of knowledge is that \x + \xo 7:12 \xt Prov. 3:18\x*wisdom preserves the life of him who has it.
\q1
\v 13 Consider \x + \xo 7:13 \xt [ch. 3:11] \x*the work of God:
\q2 \x + \xo 7:13 \xt [ch. 1:15; Job 12:14; Isa. 14:27]\x*who can make straight what he has made crooked?
\b
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14 \xt [ch. 3:4, 22; Deut. 28:47] \x*In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God has made the one as well as the other, \x + \xo 7:14 \xt [ch. 3:22; 6:12]\x*so that man may not find out anything that will be after him.
\p
\v 15 In my \x + \xo 7:15 \xt ch. 6:12; 9:9 \x*vain\f + \fr 7:15 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath” (see note on 1:2)\f* life I have seen everything. There is \x + \xo 7:15 \xt See ch. 8:14 \x*a righteous man who perishes in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man who \x + \xo 7:15 \xt ch. 8:12, 13\x*prolongs his life in his evildoing.
\v 16 Be not overly righteous, and do not \x + \xo 7:16 \xt [Rom. 12:3]\x*make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?
\v 17 Be not overly wicked, neither be a fool. \x + \xo 7:17 \xt [Prov. 10:27]; See Job 22:16\x*Why should you die before your time?
\v 18 It is good that you should take hold of \x + \xo 7:18 \xt [ver. 17] \x*this, and from \x + \xo 7:18 \xt [ver. 16] \x*that \x + \xo 7:18 \xt ch. 11:6\x*withhold not your hand, for the one who fears God shall come out from both of them.
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19 \xt ch. 9:16, 18; Prov. 21:22; 24:5\x*Wisdom gives strength to the wise man more than ten rulers who are in a city.
\p
\v 20 Surely \x + \xo 7:20 \xt See 1 Kgs. 8:46\x*there is not a righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.
\p
\v 21 Do not take to heart all the things that people say, lest you hear \x + \xo 7:21 \xt Prov. 30:10\x*your servant cursing you.
\v 22 Your heart knows that \x + \xo 7:22 \xt [Gal. 6:1]\x*many times you yourself have cursed others.
\p
\v 23 All this I have tested by wisdom. \x + \xo 7:23 \xt [Rom. 1:22]\x*I said, “I will be wise,” but it was far from me.
\v 24 That which has been is far off, and \x + \xo 7:24 \xt [Rom. 11:33] \x*deep, very deep; \x + \xo 7:24 \xt Job 28:12, 20; [1 Tim. 6:16]\x*who can find it out?
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 7:25 \xt See ch. 1:17\x*I turned my heart to know and to search out and to seek wisdom and the scheme of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the foolishness that is madness.
\v 26 And I find something more \x + \xo 7:26 \xt Prov. 5:4 \x*bitter than death: \x + \xo 7:26 \xt See Prov. 2:16 \x*the woman whose heart is \x + \xo 7:26 \xt Prov. 12:12; [Prov. 23:28] \x*snares and nets, and whose hands are fetters. He who pleases God escapes her, but \x + \xo 7:26 \xt Prov. 22:14\x*the sinner is taken by her.
\v 27 Behold, this is what I found, says \x + \xo 7:27 \xt See ch. 1:1\x*the Preacher, while adding one thing to another to find the scheme of things—
\v 28 which my soul has sought repeatedly, but I have not found. \x + \xo 7:28 \xt Job 33:23; [ver. 20] \x*One man among a thousand I found, but \x + \xo 7:28 \xt [1 Kgs. 11:3]\x*a woman among all these I have not found.
\v 29 See, this alone I found, that \x + \xo 7:29 \xt [Gen. 1:27] \x*God made man upright, but \x + \xo 7:29 \xt [Gen. 3:6, 7]\x*they have sought out many schemes.
\c 8
\s1 Keep the King’s Command
\q1
\v 1 Who is like the wise?
\q2 And who knows the interpretation of a thing?
\q1 \x + \xo 8:1 \xt Prov. 4:8, 9; [Acts 6:15] \x*A man’s wisdom makes his face shine,
\q2 and \x + \xo 8:1 \xt Prov. 21:29; [Deut. 28:50]\x*the hardness of his face is changed.
\b
\p
\v 2 I say:\f + \fr 8:2 \ft Hebrew lacks \fq say\f* Keep the king’s command, because of \x + \xo 8:2 \xt Ex. 22:11; 2 Sam. 21:7; 1 Kgs. 2:43; [2 Chr. 36:13; Ezek. 17:18]\x*God’s oath to him.\f + \fr 8:2 \ft Or \fq because of your oath to God\f*
\v 3 Be not hasty to \x + \xo 8:3 \xt [ch. 10:4]\x*go from his presence. Do not take your stand in an evil cause, for he does whatever he pleases.
\v 4 For the word of the king is supreme, and \x + \xo 8:4 \xt Dan. 4:35; See Job 9:12\x*who may say to him, “What are you doing?”
\v 5 Whoever keeps a command will know no evil thing, and the wise heart will know the proper time and the just way.
\v 6 For there is a time and a way \x + \xo 8:6 \xt ch. 3:1, 17\x*for everything, although man’s trouble\f + \fr 8:6 \ft Or \fq evil\f* lies heavy on him.
\v 7 For he \x + \xo 8:7 \xt [Prov. 24:22] \x*does not know what is to be, for \x + \xo 8:7 \xt ch. 3:22; 6:12; 9:12; 10:14\x*who can tell him how it will be?
\v 8 No man has power to \x + \xo 8:8 \xt [Job 14:5] \x*retain the spirit, \x + \xo 8:8 \xt [ch. 3:19; 9:11] \x*or power over the day of death. There is no \x + \xo 8:8 \xt See Deut. 20:5-8\x*discharge from war, nor will wickedness deliver those who are given to it.
\v 9 \x + \xo 8:9 \xt [ch. 1:13]\x*All this I observed while applying my heart to all that is done under the sun, when man had power over man to his hurt.
\s1 Those Who Fear God Will Do Well
\p
\v 10 Then I saw the wicked buried. They used to go in and out of \x + \xo 8:10 \xt [Neh. 11:1; Matt. 24:15] \x*the holy place and were \x + \xo 8:10 \xt [ch. 9:5; Prov. 10:7]\x*praised\f + \fr 8:10 \ft Some Hebrew manuscripts, Septuagint, Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts \fq forgotten\f* in the city where they had done such things. This also is vanity.\f + \fr 8:10 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath”; also twice in verse 14 (see note on 1:2)\f*
\v 11 Because \x + \xo 8:11 \xt [Ps. 10:6; 50:21; Isa. 26:10; Rom. 2:4, 5; 2 Pet. 3:9] \x*the sentence against an evil deed is not executed speedily, \x + \xo 8:11 \xt [Esth. 7:5; Acts 5:3]\x*the heart of the children of man is fully set to do evil.
\v 12 Though a sinner does evil a hundred times and \x + \xo 8:12 \xt ch. 7:15; Isa. 65:20 \x*prolongs his life, yet I know that \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [Deut. 12:25; Isa. 3:10] \x*it will be well with \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [Ps. 37:11, 18, 19; Prov. 1:33; Matt. 25:34]\x*those who fear God, because they fear before him.
\v 13 But it will \x + \xo 8:13 \xt Isa. 3:11 \x*not be well with the wicked, neither will he prolong his days like \x + \xo 8:13 \xt ch. 6:12; See Job 14:2\x*a shadow, because he does not fear before God.
\s1 Man Cannot Know God’s Ways
\p
\v 14 There is a vanity that takes place on earth, that there are righteous people \x + \xo 8:14 \xt ch. 7:15; [Ps. 73:3]; See ch. 2:14 \x*to whom it happens according to the deeds of the wicked, and there are wicked people \x + \xo 8:14 \xt [Job 21:7; Ps. 17:9, 10; 73:12; Jer. 12:1]\x*to whom it happens according to the deeds of the righteous. I said that this also is vanity.
\v 15 And I commend joy, for man \x + \xo 8:15 \xt See ch. 2:24 \x*has nothing better under the sun but to \x + \xo 8:15 \xt 1 Kgs. 4:20\x*eat and drink and be joyful, for this will go with him in his toil through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun.
\p
\v 16 When I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to see \x + \xo 8:16 \xt ch. 1:13; 3:10 \x*the business that is done on earth, how neither \x + \xo 8:16 \xt [Ps. 127:2]\x*day nor night do one’s eyes see sleep,
\v 17 then I saw all the work of God, that \x + \xo 8:17 \xt [Prov. 25:2]; See ch. 3:11 \x*man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun. However much man may toil in seeking, he will not find it out. Even though a wise man claims to know, \x + \xo 8:17 \xt [Ps. 73:16]\x*he cannot find it out.
\c 9
\s1 Death Comes to All
\p
\v 1 But all this I laid to heart, examining it all, \x + \xo 9:1 \xt [ch. 8:14] \x*how the righteous and the wise and their deeds are \x + \xo 9:1 \xt Deut. 33:3\x*in the hand of God. Whether it is love or hate, man does not know; both are before him.
\v 2 \x + \xo 9:2 \xt Job 9:22 \x*It is the same for all, since \x + \xo 9:2 \xt See ch. 2:14 \x*the same event happens to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the evil,\f + \fr 9:2 \ft Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate; Hebrew lacks \fq and the evil\f* to the clean and the unclean, to him who sacrifices and him who does not sacrifice. As the good one is, so is the sinner, and he who \x + \xo 9:2 \xt Zech. 5:3; [Mal. 3:5]\x*swears is as he who shuns an oath.
\v 3 This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that \x + \xo 9:3 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*the same event happens to all. Also, the hearts of the children of man are full of evil, and \x + \xo 9:3 \xt ch. 1:17\x*madness is in their hearts while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
\v 4 But he who is joined with all the living has hope, for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
\v 5 For the living know that they will die, but \x + \xo 9:5 \xt Job 14:21 \x*the dead know nothing, and they have no more reward, for \x + \xo 9:5 \xt ch. 1:11; 8:10; Ps. 31:12; 88:5, 12; Isa. 26:14\x*the memory of them is forgotten.
\v 6 Their love and their hate and their envy have already perished, and forever they have no more share in all that is done under the sun.
\s1 Enjoy Life with the One You Love
\p
\v 7 Go, \x + \xo 9:7 \xt See ch. 2:24\x*eat your bread with joy, and drink your wine with a merry heart, for God has already approved what you do.
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 9:8 \xt [Rev. 3:4] \x*Let your garments be always white. Let not \x + \xo 9:8 \xt Ps. 23:5\x*oil be lacking on your head.
\p
\v 9 Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your \x + \xo 9:9 \xt ch. 6:12; 7:15 \x*vain\f + \fr 9:9 \ft The Hebrew term \+tl hebel\+tl* can refer to a “vapor” or “mere breath” (see note on 1:2)\f* life that he has given you under the sun, because that is your \x + \xo 9:9 \xt See ch. 2:10\x*portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun.
\v 10 Whatever your hand finds to do, \x + \xo 9:10 \xt Rom. 12:11; Col. 3:23 \x*do it with your might,\f + \fr 9:10 \ft Or \fq finds to do with your might, do it\f* \x + \xo 9:10 \xt [ver. 5]\x*for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.
\s1 Wisdom Better than Folly
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11 \xt ch. 4:1, 7 \x*Again I saw that under the sun \x + \xo 9:11 \xt Amos 2:14, 15; [Rom. 9:16] \x*the race is not to the swift, nor \x + \xo 9:11 \xt [2 Chr. 20:15; Jer. 9:23] \x*the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise, nor riches to the intelligent, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and \x + \xo 9:11 \xt [1 Kgs. 22:34] \x*chance \x + \xo 9:11 \xt See ch. 2:14\x*happen to them all.
\v 12 For man \x + \xo 9:12 \xt [ch. 8:7] \x*does not know his time. Like fish that are taken in an evil net, and \x + \xo 9:12 \xt Prov. 7:23 \x*like birds that are caught in a snare, so the children of man are \x + \xo 9:12 \xt [Prov. 29:6; Ezek. 12:13; Hos. 7:12; Luke 21:34, 35; 1 Thess. 5:3]\x*snared at an evil time, when it suddenly falls upon them.
\p
\v 13 I have also seen this example of wisdom under the sun, and it seemed great to me.
\v 14 There was a little city with few men in it, and a great king came against it and besieged it, building great siegeworks against it.
\v 15 But there was found in it \x + \xo 9:15 \xt [ch. 4:13] \x*a poor, wise man, and he by his \x + \xo 9:15 \xt ver. 18; [2 Sam. 20:22]\x*wisdom delivered the city. Yet no one remembered that poor man.
\v 16 But I say that \x + \xo 9:16 \xt See ch. 7:19 \x*wisdom is better than might, though \x + \xo 9:16 \xt [Mark 6:2, 3]\x*the poor man’s wisdom is despised and his words are not heard.
\p
\v 17 The words of the wise heard in \x + \xo 9:17 \xt ch. 4:6\x*quiet are better than the shouting of a ruler among fools.
\v 18 \x + \xo 9:18 \xt ver. 16 \x*Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but \x + \xo 9:18 \xt [Josh. 7:1]\x*one sinner destroys much good.
\b
\c 10
\q1 \v 1 Dead flies make \x + \xo 10:1 \xt Ex. 30:25\x*the perfumer’s ointment give off a stench;
\q2 so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
\q1
\v 2 \x + \xo 10:2 \xt [ch. 2:14]\x*A wise man’s heart inclines him to the right,
\q2 but a fool’s heart to the left.
\q1
\v 3 Even when the fool walks on the road, he lacks sense,
