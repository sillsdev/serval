\v 6 which has come to you, as indeed \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [ver. 23; Ps. 98:3]; See Matt. 24:14 \x*in the whole world it is \x + \xo 1:6 \xt John 15:5, 16; [Phil. 1:11] \x*bearing fruit and increasing—as it also does among you, since the day you \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [Rom. 16:26; Eph. 4:21] \x*heard it and understood \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Acts 11:23\x*the grace of God in truth,
\v 7 just as you learned it from \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ch. 4:12; Philem. 23 \x*Epaphras our beloved \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ch. 4:7\x*fellow servant.\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Greek \fq fellow bondservant\f* He is \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ch. 4:7\x*a faithful minister of Christ on your\f + \fr 1:7 \ft Some manuscripts \fq our\f* behalf

\s1 The Preeminence of Christ
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt See 2 Cor. 4:4 \x*He is the image of \x + \xo 1:15 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:17 \x*the invisible God, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Ps. 89:27]; See Rom. 8:29\x*the firstborn of all creation.
\v 16 For by\f + \fr 1:16 \ft That is, by means of; or \fq in\f* him all things were created, \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Eph. 1:10 \x*in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether \x + \xo 1:16 \xt [Ezek. 10:1] \x*thrones or \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Eph. 1:21 \x*dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Rom. 11:36; 1 Cor. 8:6\x*through him and for him.
\v 17 And \x + \xo 1:17 \xt [John 8:58]; See John 1:1 \x*he is before all things, and in him all things \x + \xo 1:17 \xt [Heb. 1:3]\x*hold together.
\v 18 And \x + \xo 1:18 \xt See Eph. 1:22, 23 \x*he is the head of the body, the church. He is \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Rev. 3:14 \x*the beginning, \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Acts 26:23; 1 Cor. 15:20; Rev. 1:5\x*the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.
\v 19 For \x + \xo 1:19 \xt ch. 2:9 \x*in him all the \x + \xo 1:19 \xt See John 1:16\x*fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
\v 20 and \x + \xo 1:20 \xt See 2 Cor. 5:18; Eph. 1:10 \x*through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, \x + \xo 1:20 \xt See Eph. 2:14 \x*making peace \x + \xo 1:20 \xt [Eph. 2:13]\x*by the blood of his cross.
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21 \xt See Eph. 2:1, 2, 12 \x*And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [Titus 1:16]\x*doing evil deeds,
\v 22 he has now reconciled \x + \xo 1:22 \xt [Rom. 7:4] \x*in his body of flesh by his death, \x + \xo 1:22 \xt Jude 24; See Eph. 1:4; 5:27 \x*in order to present you holy and blameless and \x + \xo 1:22 \xt 1 Cor. 1:8\x*above reproach before him,
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23 \xt See John 15:4 \x*if indeed you continue in the faith, \x + \xo 1:23 \xt ch. 2:7; Eph. 3:17 \x*stable and steadfast, not shifting from \x + \xo 1:23 \xt ver. 5, 6 \x*the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Mark 16:15; [Acts 2:5] \x*in all creation\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Or \fq to every creature\f* under heaven, \x + \xo 1:23 \xt See 2 Cor. 3:6\x*and of which I, Paul, became a minister.
\s1 Paul’s Ministry to the Church
\p
\v 24 Now \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See 2 Cor. 7:4 \x*I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh \x + \xo 1:24 \xt [2 Tim. 1:8; 2:10] \x*I am filling up \x + \xo 1:24 \xt See 2 Cor. 1:5 \x*what is lacking in Christ’s afflictions \x + \xo 1:24 \xt [Eph. 4:12]\x*for the sake of his body, that is, the church,
\v 25 \x + \xo 1:25 \xt ver. 23 \x*of which I became a minister according to \x + \xo 1:25 \xt See Eph. 3:2\x*the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,
\v 26 \x + \xo 1:26 \xt Eph. 3:9; See Rom. 16:25, 26\x*the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints.
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27 \xt [ch. 2:2] \x*To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are \x + \xo 1:27 \xt Eph. 1:18; 3:16 \x*the riches of the glory of \x + \xo 1:27 \xt [See ver. 26 above] \x*this mystery, which is Christ in you, \x + \xo 1:27 \xt 1 Tim. 1:1\x*the hope of glory.
\v 28 Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that \x + \xo 1:28 \xt See ver. 22, 23 \x*we may present everyone \x + \xo 1:28 \xt See Matt. 5:48\x*mature in Christ.
\v 29 For this \x + \xo 1:29 \xt 1 Cor. 15:10; 1 Tim. 4:10 \x*I toil, \x + \xo 1:29 \xt ch. 4:12; [ch. 2:1] \x*struggling \x + \xo 1:29 \xt See Eph. 1:19\x*with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.
\c 2
\p \v 1 For I want you to know \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Phil. 1:30 \x*how great a \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [See ch. 1:29 above]\x*struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face,
\v 2 that \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 4:8; Eph. 6:22 \x*their hearts may be encouraged, being \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [ch. 3:14] \x*knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of \x + \xo 2:2 \xt See ch. 1:27\x*God’s mystery, which is Christ,
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Isa. 11:2; 45:3; 1 Cor. 1:24, 30; 2:6, 7; [Luke 11:49; Eph. 1:8]\x*in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
\v 4 I say this in order \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Rom. 16:18; [Eph. 5:6; 2 Pet. 2:3]\x*that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.
\v 5 For \x + \xo 2:5 \xt 1 Cor. 5:3 \x*though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your \x + \xo 2:5 \xt 1 Cor. 14:40 \x*good order and \x + \xo 2:5 \xt 1 Pet. 5:9\x*the firmness of your faith in Christ.
\s1 Alive in Christ
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt ch. 1:10; 1 Thess. 4:1\x*Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Eph. 3:17 \x*rooted and \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Acts 20:32; Eph. 2:20; See 1 Cor. 3:9 \x*built up in him and \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Heb. 13:9 \x*established in the faith, just \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Eph. 4:21 \x*as you were taught, abounding \x + \xo 2:7 \xt ch. 4:2; Eph. 5:20\x*in thanksgiving.
\p
\v 8 See to it that no one takes you captive by \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [1 Tim. 6:20] \x*philosophy and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Eph. 5:6 \x*empty deceit, according to \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See Matt. 15:2 \x*human tradition, according to the \x + \xo 2:8 \xt ver. 20\x*elemental spirits\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Or \fq elementary principles\ft ; also verse 20\f* of the world, and not according to Christ.
\v 9 For \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ch. 1:19; John 1:14 \x*in him the whole fullness of deity dwells \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [ver. 17]\x*bodily,
\v 10 and \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Eph. 3:19 \x*you have been filled in him, who is \x + \xo 2:10 \xt See Eph. 1:21, 22\x*the head of all rule and authority.
\v 11 In him also \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [Eph. 2:11]; See Rom. 2:29 \x*you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ver. 15; ch. 3:9\x*putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Rom. 6:4 \x*having been buried with him in baptism, in which \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ch. 3:1; [Rom. 6:5] \x*you were also raised with him through faith in \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [1 Cor. 6:14]; See Acts 2:24; Eph. 1:19\x*the powerful working of God, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [1 Cor. 6:14]; See Acts 2:24; Eph. 1:19\x*who raised him from the dead.
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See Eph. 2:1 \x*And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See Eph. 2:5\x*made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,
\v 14 by \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See Acts 3:19 \x*canceling \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See Rom. 7:4\x*the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [See ver. 11 above] \x*He disarmed the rulers and authorities\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Probably demonic rulers and authorities\f* and \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [Gen. 3:15; Ps. 68:18; Isa. 53:12; Matt. 12:29; Luke 10:18; John 12:31; 16:11; Eph. 4:8; Heb. 2:14] \x*put them to open shame, by \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Eph. 2:16\x*triumphing over them in him.\f + \fr 2:15 \ft Or \fq in it \ft (that is, the cross)\f*
\s1 Let No One Disqualify You
\p
\v 16 Therefore let no one \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Rom. 14:3, 10, 13 \x*pass judgment on you \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Rom. 14:17; Heb. 9:10; See Lev. 11:2 \x*in questions of food and drink, or with regard to \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Lev. 23:2; Rom. 14:5 \x*a festival or \x + \xo 2:16 \xt [Mark 2:28]; See Num. 28:11\x*a new moon or a Sabbath.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Heb. 8:5; 10:1 \x*These are a shadow of the things to come, but \x + \xo 2:17 \xt [ver. 2]\x*the substance belongs to Christ.
\v 18 Let no one \x + \xo 2:18 \xt 1 Cor. 9:24 \x*disqualify you, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ver. 23 \x*insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [Ezek. 13:7; 1 Tim. 1:7] \x*going on in detail about visions,\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Or \fq about the things he has seen\f* \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [Eph. 4:17] \x*puffed up without reason by \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [Rom. 8:7]\x*his sensuous mind,
\v 19 and \x + \xo 2:19 \xt See Eph. 4:15, 16 \x*not \x + \xo 2:19 \xt Rev. 2:13; 3:11\x*holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
\p
\v 20 If with Christ \x + \xo 2:20 \xt See Rom. 6:2 \x*you died to the \x + \xo 2:20 \xt ver. 8 \x*elemental spirits of the world, \x + \xo 2:20 \xt [Gal. 4:9]\x*why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations—
\v 21 \x + \xo 2:21 \xt ver. 16; 1 Tim. 4:3\x*“Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch”
\v 22 (\x + \xo 2:22 \xt 1 Cor. 6:13 \x*referring to things that all perish as they are used)—according to \x + \xo 2:22 \xt Isa. 29:13; Matt. 15:9; [Titus 1:14]\x*human precepts and teachings?
\v 23 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in \x + \xo 2:23 \xt ver. 18 \x*promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are \x + \xo 2:23 \xt [1 Tim. 4:8]\x*of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.

\s1 Put On the New Self
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ch. 2:12 \x*If then you have been raised with Christ, seek \x + \xo 3:1 \xt [Phil. 3:14] \x*the things that are above, where Christ is, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See Eph. 1:20\x*seated at the right hand of God.
\v 2 \x + \xo 3:2 \xt See Matt. 16:23\x*Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.
\v 3 For \x + \xo 3:3 \xt ch. 2:20; See Rom. 6:2\x*you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
\v 4 When Christ \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See John 11:25 \x*who is your\f + \fr 3:4 \ft Some manuscripts \fq our\f* life \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [Phil. 3:21; 1 Pet. 1:1, 7, 13; 1 John 2:28; 3:2] \x*appears, then you also will appear with him \x + \xo 3:4 \xt 1 Cor. 15:43\x*in glory.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Rom. 8:13; [Gal. 5:24] \x*Put to death therefore \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Rom. 6:13 \x*what is earthly in you:\f + \fr 3:5 \ft Greek \fq therefore your members that are on the earth\f* \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See Eph. 5:3, 5 \x*sexual immorality, impurity, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Rom. 1:26 \x*passion, evil desire, and covetousness, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt [Job 31:25, 26]\x*which is idolatry.
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See Eph. 5:6\x*On account of these the wrath of God is coming.\f + \fr 3:6 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq upon the sons of disobedience\f*
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See Eph. 2:2, 11\x*In these you too once walked, when you were living in them.
\v 8 But now \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Eph. 4:22 \x*you must put them all away: \x + \xo 3:8 \xt Eph. 4:31 \x*anger, wrath, malice, \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Eph. 4:29\x*slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Lev. 19:11; See Eph. 4:25 \x*Do not lie to one another, seeing that \x + \xo 3:9 \xt ch. 2:11 \x*you have put off \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Rom. 6:6; Eph. 4:22\x*the old self\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Greek \fq man\ft ; also as supplied in verse 10\f* with its practices
\v 10 and \x + \xo 3:10 \xt Eph. 4:24 \x*have put on \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See Rom. 6:4 \x*the new self, \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See Rom. 12:2 \x*which is being renewed in knowledge \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See Rom. 8:29 \x*after the image of \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [Eph. 2:10]\x*its creator.
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [Rom. 10:12]; See 1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 5:6 \x*Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave,\f + \fr 3:11 \ft Greek \fq bondservant\f* free; but Christ is \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Eph. 1:23\x*all, and in all.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12 \xt ver. 10 \x*Put on then, as \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Rom. 8:33 \x*God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Phil. 2:1 \x*compassionate hearts, \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Eph. 4:32 \x*kindness, \x + \xo 3:12 \xt See Eph. 4:2\x*humility, meekness, and patience,

\v 15 And let \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See Phil. 4:7 \x*the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called \x + \xo 3:15 \xt Eph. 2:16 \x*in one body. And \x + \xo 3:15 \xt ver. 17\x*be thankful.
\v 16 Let \x + \xo 3:16 \xt John 15:3 \x*the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, \x + \xo 3:16 \xt See Eph. 5:19 \x*singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, \x + \xo 3:16 \xt ch. 4:6\x*with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
