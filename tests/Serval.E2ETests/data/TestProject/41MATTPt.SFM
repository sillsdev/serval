\v 8 and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [2 Kgs. 15:1; 1 Chr. 3:11, 12]\x*and Joram the father of Uzziah,

\s1 The Birth of Jesus Christ
\p
\v 18 Now the birth of \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ver. 1; Mark 1:1; John 1:17; 17:3; [ver. 16] \x*Jesus Christ\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Some manuscripts \fq of the Christ\f* took place in this way. \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Luke 1:27 \x*When his mother Mary had been betrothed\f + \fr 1:18 \ft That is, legally pledged to be married\f* to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Luke 1:35\x*from the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling \x + \xo 1:19 \xt [Deut. 24:1]\x*to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.
\v 20 But as he considered these things, behold, \x + \xo 1:20 \xt ch. 2:13, 19; [ch. 2:12, 22]\x*an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 She will bear a son, and \x + \xo 1:21 \xt ver. 25; Luke 1:31; 2:21 \x*you shall call his name Jesus, \x + \xo 1:21 \xt Luke 2:11; Acts 4:12; 5:31; 13:23, 38; [Acts 3:26]\x*for he will save his people from their sins.”
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22 \xt ch. 21:4; 26:56; John 19:36 \x*All this took place \x + \xo 1:22 \xt ch. 2:15, 23; 4:14; Mark 14:49\x*to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:
\b
\q1
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Cited from Isa. 7:14 \x*“Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,
\q2 and they shall call his name \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Isa. 8:8, 10 \x*Immanuel”
\b
\m (which means, God \x + \xo 1:23 \xt See ch. 28:20\x*with us).
\v 24 When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife,
\v 25 but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And \x + \xo 1:25 \xt ver. 21\x*he called his name Jesus.

\s1 The Visit of the Wise Men
\p
\v 1 Now \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Luke 2:4-7 \x*after Jesus was born in \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Luke 2:15; John 7:42 \x*Bethlehem of Judea \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Luke 1:5 \x*in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Greek \+tl magi\+tl*; also verses 7, 16\f* from \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [Gen. 25:6; 1 Kgs. 4:30]\x*the east came to Jerusalem,
\v 2 saying, “Where is he who has been born \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 27:11, 37; Jer. 23:5; 30:9; Zech. 9:9 \x*king of the Jews? For we saw \x + \xo 2:2 \xt [Num. 24:17; Rev. 22:16] \x*his star when it rose\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Or \fq in the east\ft ; also verse 9\f* and have come to \x + \xo 2:2 \xt See ch. 8:2\x*worship him.”
\v 3 When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;
\v 4 and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See ch. 1:17\x*the Christ was to be born.
\v 5 They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet:
\b
\q1
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Cited from Mic. 5:2 \x*“‘And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
\q2 are by no means least among the rulers of Judah;
\q1 for from you shall come a ruler
\q2 who will \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Ezek. 34:23; John 21:15-17; [2 Sam. 5:2; Rev. 7:17]\x*shepherd my people Israel.’”
\b
\p
\v 7 Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.
\v 8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.”
\v 9 After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.
\v 10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.
\v 11 And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [1 Sam. 9:7; Ps. 72:10] \x*they offered him gifts, \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Isa. 60:6 \x*gold and \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Rev. 18:13 \x*frankincense and \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Ex. 30:23; Ps. 45:8; John 19:39\x*myrrh.
\v 12 And \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ver. 22; [ver. 13, 19] \x*being warned \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [ch. 27:19; Gen. 20:6; 31:11; Num. 12:6; Job 33:15]\x*in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.
\s1 The Flight to Egypt
\p
\v 13 Now when they had departed, behold, \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ver. 19; ch. 1:20; [ver. 12, 22]\x*an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”
\v 14 And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt
\v 15 and remained there until the death of Herod. \x + \xo 2:15 \xt See ch. 1:22 \x*This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Cited from Hos. 11:1\x*“Out of Egypt I called my son.”
\s1 Herod Kills the Children
\p
\v 16 Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ch. 27:9; [ch. 1:22]\x*Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:
\b
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Cited from Jer. 31:15 \x*“A voice was heard in Ramah,
\q2 weeping and loud lamentation,
\q1 Rachel weeping for her children;
\q2 she refused to be comforted, because they \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Gen. 42:13, 36; Lam. 5:7\x*are no more.”
\s1 The Return to Nazareth
\p
\v 19 But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\v 20 saying, “Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for \x + \xo 2:20 \xt [Ex. 4:19]\x*those who sought the child’s life are dead.”
\v 21 And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel.
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and \x + \xo 2:22 \xt See ver. 12\x*being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee.
\v 23 And he went and lived in a city called \x + \xo 2:23 \xt ch. 4:13; Mark 1:9; Luke 1:26; 2:39; 4:16; John 1:45 \x*Nazareth, \x + \xo 2:23 \xt See ch. 1:22\x*so that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, that he would be called a Nazarene.

\s1 John the Baptist Prepares the Way
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 3:1 \xt For ver. 1-12, see Mark 1:2-8; Luke 3:2-17 \x*In those days \x + \xo 3:1 \xt John 1:6, 7 \x*John the Baptist came preaching in \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Josh. 15:61; [Judg. 1:16]\x*the wilderness of Judea,
\v 2 \x + \xo 3:2 \xt ch. 4:17; Mark 1:15 \x*“Repent, for \x + \xo 3:2 \xt ch. 10:7; Dan. 2:44; [ch. 6:10]\x*the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”
\v 3 For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt John 1:23; Cited from Isa. 40:3 \x*“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:
\q1 \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Luke 1:76\x*‘Prepare\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or \fq crying: Prepare in the wilderness\f* the way of the Lord;
\q2 make his paths straight.’”
\b
\m
\v 4 Now John wore \x + \xo 3:4 \xt 2 Kgs. 1:8; Zech. 13:4; [Heb. 11:37] \x*a garment of camel’s hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Lev. 11:22 \x*locusts and \x + \xo 3:4 \xt 1 Sam. 14:26\x*wild honey.
\v 5 Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him,
\v 6 and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Acts 19:18\x*confessing their sins.
\p
\v 7 But when he saw many of \x + \xo 3:7 \xt ch. 23:13, 15 \x*the Pharisees and \x + \xo 3:7 \xt ch. 22:23 \x*Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, \x + \xo 3:7 \xt ch. 12:34; 23:33 \x*“You brood of \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Ps. 140:3 \x*vipers! Who warned you to flee from \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Rom. 5:9; Eph. 5:6; Col. 3:6; 1 Thess. 1:10\x*the wrath to come?
\v 8 Bear fruit \x + \xo 3:8 \xt Acts 26:20\x*in keeping with repentance.
\v 9 And do not presume to say to yourselves, \x + \xo 3:9 \xt John 8:39 \x*‘We have Abraham as our father,’ for I tell you, God is able from \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [ch. 4:3]\x*these stones to raise up children for Abraham.
\v 10 Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. \x + \xo 3:10 \xt ch. 7:19; Luke 13:7, 9; John 15:2, 6\x*Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt John 1:26; Acts 1:5 \x*“I baptize you with water \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Acts 13:24; 19:4 \x*for repentance, but \x + \xo 3:11 \xt John 1:15, 27; 3:30, 31; Acts 13:25 \x*he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you \x + \xo 3:11 \xt John 1:33; Acts 11:16 \x*with the Holy Spirit and \x + \xo 3:11 \xt [Isa. 4:4; Mal. 3:2, 3; Acts 2:3]\x*fire.
\v 12 His \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Isa. 30:24 \x*winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and \x + \xo 3:12 \xt ch. 13:30 \x*gather his wheat into the barn, \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Mal. 4:1 \x*but the chaff he will burn with \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Mark 9:43, 48\x*unquenchable fire.”
\s1 The Baptism of Jesus
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13 \xt For ver. 13-17, see Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21, 22; [John 1:32-34] \x*Then Jesus came \x + \xo 3:13 \xt ch. 2:22\x*from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14 \xt [John 13:6]\x*John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”
\v 15 But Jesus answered him, \wj “Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.”\wj* Then he consented.
\v 16 And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, \x + \xo 3:16 \xt Acts 7:56 \x*the heavens were opened to him,\f + \fr 3:16 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq to him\f* and he \x + \xo 3:16 \xt John 1:32, 33; [Luke 4:18, 21; Acts 10:38]\x*saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him;
\v 17 and behold, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt John 12:28 \x*a voice from heaven said, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt ch. 17:5; 2 Pet. 1:17; [Ps. 2:7; Isa. 42:1; Eph. 1:6; Col. 1:13; 1 John 5:9]\x*“This is my beloved Son,\f + \fr 3:17 \ft Or \fq my Son, my \ft (or \fq the\ft ) \fq Beloved\f* with whom I am well pleased.”

\s1 The Temptation of Jesus
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1 \xt For ver. 1-11, see Mark 1:12, 13; Luke 4:1-13 \x*Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness \x + \xo 4:1 \xt [Heb. 2:18; 4:15]\x*to be tempted by the devil.

\v 24 So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that \x + \xo 27:24 \xt ch. 26:5 \x*a riot was beginning, he took water and \x + \xo 27:24 \xt [Deut. 21:6-8; Ps. 26:6; 73:13] \x*washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of \x + \xo 27:24 \xt ver. 19 \x*this man’s blood;\f + \fr 27:24 \ft Some manuscripts \fq this righteous blood\ft , or \fq this righteous man’s blood\f* \x + \xo 27:24 \xt ver. 4\x*see to it yourselves.”
\v 25 And all the people answered, \x + \xo 27:25 \xt [ch. 23:35, 36; Josh. 2:19; Acts 5:28] \x*“His blood be on us and \x + \xo 27:25 \xt [Ex. 20:5; Lam. 5:7]\x*on our children!”
\v 26 Then he released for them Barabbas, and having \x + \xo 27:26 \xt ch. 20:19; Isa. 50:6; 53:5; [Luke 23:16; John 19:1]\x*scourged\f + \fr 27:26 \ft A Roman judicial penalty, consisting of a severe beating with a multi-lashed whip containing imbedded pieces of bone and metal\f* Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.
\s1 Jesus Is Mocked
\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 27:27 \xt For ver. 27-31, see Mark 15:16-20; John 19:2, 3 \x*Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the \x + \xo 27:27 \xt John 18:28, 33; 19:9; Acts 23:35; Phil. 1:13 (Gk.) \x*governor’s headquarters,\f + \fr 27:27 \ft Greek \fq the \+tl praetorium\+tl*\f* and they gathered the whole \x + \xo 27:27 \xt See Acts 10:1 (Gk.)\x*battalion\f + \fr 27:27 \ft Greek \fq cohort\ft ; a tenth of a Roman legion, usually about 600 men\f* before him.
\v 28 And they stripped him and put \x + \xo 27:28 \xt Rev. 18:12, 16; [Luke 23:11]\x*a scarlet robe on him,
\v 29 and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they \x + \xo 27:29 \xt ch. 20:19 \x*mocked him, saying, “Hail, \x + \xo 27:29 \xt See ver. 11\x*King of the Jews!”
\v 30 And \x + \xo 27:30 \xt See ch. 26:67\x*they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.
\v 31 And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and \x + \xo 27:31 \xt Isa. 53:7\x*led him away to crucify him.
\s1 The Crucifixion
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 27:32 \xt Mark 15:21; Luke 23:26; [John 19:17] \x*\x + \xo 27:32 \xt Heb. 13:12; [ch. 21:39; Num. 15:35]\x*As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to \x + \xo 27:32 \xt Mark 15:21; Luke 23:26; [John 19:17] \x*carry his cross.
\v 33 \x + \xo 27:33 \xt For ver. 33-51, see Mark 15:22-38; Luke 23:32-38, 44-46; John 19:17-19, 23, 24, 28-30\x*And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),
\v 34 \x + \xo 27:34 \xt [Ps. 69:21] \x*they offered him wine to drink, mixed with \x + \xo 27:34 \xt Acts 8:23\x*gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.
\v 35 And when they had crucified him, \x + \xo 27:35 \xt Ps. 22:18\x*they divided his garments among them by casting lots.
\v 36 Then they sat down and \x + \xo 27:36 \xt ver. 54; [Ps. 22:17]\x*kept watch over him there.
\v 37 And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, \x + \xo 27:37 \xt ver. 11, 29\x*the King of the Jews.”
\v 38 Then two \x + \xo 27:38 \xt [John 18:40] \x*robbers were crucified with him, \x + \xo 27:38 \xt [ch. 20:21]\x*one on the right and one on the left.
\v 39 And \x + \xo 27:39 \xt Ps. 22:7; 109:25; [Lam. 1:12] \x*those who passed by \x + \xo 27:39 \xt Luke 22:65; 23:39; [James 2:7] \x*derided him, \x + \xo 27:39 \xt Job 16:4; Isa. 37:22; Jer. 18:16; Lam. 2:15\x*wagging their heads
\v 40 and saying, \x + \xo 27:40 \xt ch. 26:61 \x*“You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! \x + \xo 27:40 \xt ch. 4:3, 6 \x*If you are \x + \xo 27:40 \xt ver. 43; ch. 26:63; See ch. 14:33\x*the Son of God, come down from the cross.”
\v 41 So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,
\v 42 \x + \xo 27:42 \xt [Luke 4:23] \x*“He saved others; \x + \xo 27:42 \xt [ch. 26:53, 54; John 10:18] \x*he cannot save himself. \x + \xo 27:42 \xt John 1:49; 12:13; [ver. 37]\x*He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
\v 43 \x + \xo 27:43 \xt Cited from Ps. 22:8\x*He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
\v 44 \x + \xo 27:44 \xt [Luke 23:39-43]\x*And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.
\s1 The Death of Jesus
\p
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour\f + \fr 27:45 \ft That is, noon\f* there was darkness over all the land\f + \fr 27:45 \ft Or \fq earth\f* until the ninth hour.\f + \fr 27:45 \ft That is, 3 \sc p.m.\sc*\f*
\v 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus \x + \xo 27:46 \xt [Heb. 5:7] \x*cried out with a loud voice, saying, \x + \xo 27:46 \xt Cited from Ps. 22:1\x*\wj “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”\wj* that is, \wj “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”\wj*
\v 47 And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”
\v 48 And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with \x + \xo 27:48 \xt Ruth 2:14 \x*sour wine, and put it on a reed and \x + \xo 27:48 \xt Ps. 69:21\x*gave it to him to drink.
\v 49 But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”
\v 50 And Jesus \x + \xo 27:50 \xt ver. 46 \x*cried out again with a loud voice and \x + \xo 27:50 \xt [John 10:18]\x*yielded up his spirit.
\p
\v 51 And behold, \x + \xo 27:51 \xt Ex. 26:31-33; 2 Chr. 3:14 \x*the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And \x + \xo 27:51 \xt ver. 54\x*the earth shook, and the rocks were split.
\v 52 The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of \x + \xo 27:52 \xt [Dan. 7:18, 22] \x*the saints \x + \xo 27:52 \xt John 11:11-13; Acts 7:60; 13:36; 1 Cor. 15:6, 18, 20; 1 Thess. 4:13-15; 2 Pet. 3:4\x*who had fallen asleep were raised,
\v 53 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into \x + \xo 27:53 \xt See ch. 4:5\x*the holy city and appeared to many.
\v 54 \x + \xo 27:54 \xt For ver. 54-56, see Mark 15:39-41; Luke 23:47, 49 \x*When the centurion and those who were with him, \x + \xo 27:54 \xt ver. 36 \x*keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, \x + \xo 27:54 \xt ver. 43\x*“Truly this was the Son\f + \fr 27:54 \ft Or \fq a son\f* of God!”
\p
\v 55 There were also \x + \xo 27:55 \xt John 19:25 \x*many women there, looking on \x + \xo 27:55 \xt Ps. 38:11 \x*from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, \x + \xo 27:55 \xt See Luke 8:2, 3\x*ministering to him,
\v 56 among whom were \x + \xo 27:56 \xt [See ver. 55 above] \x*Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and \x + \xo 27:56 \xt ch. 20:20; [Mark 15:40]\x*the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
\s1 Jesus Is Buried
\p
\v 57 \x + \xo 27:57 \xt For ver. 57-61, see Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42\x*When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.
\v 58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.
\v 59 And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud
\v 60 and \x + \xo 27:60 \xt [Isa. 53:9] \x*laid it in his own new tomb, \x + \xo 27:60 \xt Isa. 22:16 \x*which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled \x + \xo 27:60 \xt Mark 16:4; [John 11:38]\x*a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.
\v 61 Mary Magdalene and \x + \xo 27:61 \xt ver. 56; ch. 28:1\x*the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.
\s1 The Guard at the Tomb
\p
\v 62 The next day, that is, after the day of \x + \xo 27:62 \xt Mark 15:42; Luke 23:54; John 19:14, 31, 42\x*Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
\v 63 and said, “Sir, we remember how \x + \xo 27:63 \xt [ver. 64; John 7:12] \x*that impostor said, while he was still alive, \x + \xo 27:63 \xt ch. 16:21; 17:23; 20:19; 28:6; Mark 8:31; 10:34; Luke 9:22; 18:33; 24:6, 7; [ch. 26:61; John 2:19]\x*‘After three days I will rise.’
\v 64 Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, \x + \xo 27:64 \xt [ch. 28:13]\x*lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, ‘He has risen from the dead,’ and the last fraud will be worse than the first.”
\v 65 Pilate said to them, “You have \x + \xo 27:65 \xt ch. 28:11\x*a guard\f + \fr 27:65 \ft Or \fq Take a guard\f* of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can.”
\v 66 So they went and made the tomb secure by \x + \xo 27:66 \xt Dan. 6:17\x*sealing the stone and setting a guard.
\c 28
\s1 The Resurrection
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 28:1 \xt For ver. 1-8, see Mark 16:1-8; Luke 24:1-10; John 20:1 \x*Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and \x + \xo 28:1 \xt ch. 27:56, 61\x*the other Mary went to see the tomb.
\v 2 And behold, there was a great earthquake, for \x + \xo 28:2 \xt [John 20:12]\x*an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.
\v 3 \x + \xo 28:3 \xt Dan. 10:6 \x*His appearance was like lightning, and \x + \xo 28:3 \xt [Dan. 7:9; Mark 9:3; John 20:12; Acts 1:10]\x*his clothing white as snow.
\v 4 And for fear of him the guards trembled and \x + \xo 28:4 \xt [Rev. 1:17]\x*became like dead men.
\v 5 But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.
\v 6 He is not here, for he has risen, \x + \xo 28:6 \xt ch. 27:63\x*as he said. Come, see the place where he\f + \fr 28:6 \ft Some manuscripts \fq the Lord\f* lay.
\v 7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, \x + \xo 28:7 \xt ver. 10, 16; ch. 26:32\x*he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you.”
\v 8 So they departed quickly from the tomb \x + \xo 28:8 \xt [Ps. 2:11]\x*with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.
\v 9 And behold, Jesus \x + \xo 28:9 \xt [Mark 16:9; John 20:14] \x*met them and said, \wj “Greetings!”\wj* And they came up and \x + \xo 28:9 \xt 2 Kgs. 4:27 \x*took hold of his feet and \x + \xo 28:9 \xt ver. 17; Luke 24:52\x*worshiped him.
\v 10 Then Jesus said to them, \wj “Do not be afraid; \wj*\x + \xo 28:10 \xt See John 20:18 \x*\wj go and tell \wj*\x + \xo 28:10 \xt John 20:17; [Ps. 22:22; Rom. 8:29; Heb. 2:11, 12, 17]\x*\wj my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”\wj*
\s1 The Report of the Guard
\p
\v 11 While they were going, behold, some of \x + \xo 28:11 \xt ch. 27:65, 66\x*the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.
\v 12 And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers
\v 13 and said, “Tell people, \x + \xo 28:13 \xt [ch. 27:64]\x*‘His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.’
\v 14 And if this comes to \x + \xo 28:14 \xt ch. 27:2 \x*the governor’s ears, we will \x + \xo 28:14 \xt See Acts 12:20 (Gk.)\x*satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”
\v 15 So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews \x + \xo 28:15 \xt ch. 27:8\x*to this day.
\s1 The Great Commission
\p
\v 16 Now the eleven disciples \x + \xo 28:16 \xt ver. 7\x*went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.
\v 17 And when they saw him they \x + \xo 28:17 \xt ver. 9\x*worshiped him, but some doubted.
\v 18 And Jesus came and said to them, \x + \xo 28:18 \xt ch. 11:27; Dan. 7:13, 14; John 3:35; 13:3; 17:2; Acts 2:36; Rom. 14:9; 1 Cor. 15:27; Eph. 1:10, 20-22; Phil. 2:9, 10; Col. 2:10; Heb. 1:2; 2:8; 1 Pet. 3:22; [ch. 9:6; John 5:27] \x*\wj “All authority \wj*\x + \xo 28:18 \xt [ch. 6:10; Luke 2:14]\x*\wj in heaven and on earth has been given to me.\wj*
