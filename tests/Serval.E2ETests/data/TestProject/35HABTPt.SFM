\s1 Habakkuk’s Complaint
\q1
\v 2 O \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Ps. 13:1; 89:46 \x*how long shall I cry for help,
\q2 and you will not hear?
\q1 Or cry to you \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Mic. 6:12\x*“Violence!”
\q2 and you will not save?
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See Jer. 9:2-6 \x*Why do you make me see iniquity,
\q2 and why do you idly look at wrong?
\q1 Destruction \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [See ver. 2 above]\x*and violence are before me;
\q2 strife and contention arise.
\q1
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [Mic. 7:3] \x*So the law is paralyzed,
\q2 and justice never goes forth.
\q1 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [Job 21:7; Jer. 12:1]\x*For the wicked surround the righteous;
\q2 so justice goes forth perverted.

\q1
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Cited Acts 13:41 \x*“Look among the nations, and see;
\q2 wonder and be astounded.
\q1 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [Isa. 28:21; 29:14]\x*For I am doing a work in your days
\q2 that you would not believe if told.
\q1
\v 6 For behold, \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Jer. 5:15 \x*I am raising up the Chaldeans,
\q2 that bitter and hasty nation,
\q1 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [ch. 2:5] \x*who march through the breadth of the earth,
\q2 \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [ch. 2:6]\x*to seize dwellings not their own.
\q1
\v 7 They are dreaded and fearsome;
\q2 \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [ver. 10, 11]\x*their justice and dignity go forth from themselves.
\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Jer. 4:13 \x*Their horses are swifter than leopards,
\q2 more fierce than \x + \xo 1:8 \xt Jer. 5:6; Zeph. 3:3 \x*the evening wolves;
\q2 their horsemen press proudly on.
\q1 Their horsemen come from afar;
\q2 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt See Deut. 28:49\x*they fly like an eagle swift to devour.
\q1
\v 9 They all come \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [ch. 2:17] \x*for violence,
\q2 all their faces forward.
\q2 They gather captives \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See Josh. 11:4\x*like sand.
\q1
\v 10 At kings they scoff,
\q2 and at rulers they laugh.
\q1 \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Nah. 3:12] \x*They laugh at every fortress,
\q2 for \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Ezek. 4:2]\x*they pile up earth and take it.
\q1
\v 11 Then they sweep by like the wind and go on,
\q2 \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [Hos. 13:16] \x*guilty men, \x + \xo 1:11 \xt [ver. 7]\x*whose own might is their god!”
\s1 Habakkuk’s Second Complaint
\q1
\v 12 Are you not \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Deut. 33:27; Ps. 90:2; 93:2 \x*from everlasting,
\q2 O \nd Lord\nd* my God, my Holy One?
\q2 \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [Mal. 3:6] \x*We shall not die.
\q1 O \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt See Isa. 10:5-7 \x*you have ordained them as a judgment,
\q2 and you, O \x + \xo 1:12 \xt See Deut. 32:4\x*Rock, have established them for reproof.
\q1
\v 13 You who are \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [Ps. 5:5] \x*of purer eyes than to see evil
\q2 and cannot look at wrong,
\q1 \x + \xo 1:13 \xt Jer. 12:1 \x*why do you idly look at traitors
\q2 and \x + \xo 1:13 \xt Ps. 35:22\x*remain silent when the wicked swallows up
\q2 the man more righteous than he?
\q1
\v 14 You make mankind like the fish of the sea,
\q2 like crawling things that have no ruler.
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt Jer. 16:16; Amos 4:2 \x*He\f + \fr 1:15 \ft That is, the wicked foe\f* brings all of them up \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Isa. 19:8]\x*with a hook;
\q2 he drags them out with his net;
\q1 he gathers them in his dragnet;
\q2 so he rejoices and is glad.
\q1
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16 \xt [ver. 11]\x*Therefore he sacrifices to his net
\q2 and makes offerings to his dragnet;
\q1 for by them he lives in luxury,\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Hebrew \fq his portion is fat\f*
\q2 and his food is rich.
\q1
\v 17 Is he then to keep on emptying his net
\q2 \x + \xo 1:17 \xt [ch. 2:10]\x*and mercilessly killing nations forever?
\b
\c 2
\q1 \v 1 I will \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Isa. 21:8 \x*take my stand at my watchpost
\q2 and station myself on the tower,
\q1 and \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Jer. 6:17; Ezek. 33:2 \x*look out to see \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Ps. 85:8\x*what he will say to me,
\q2 and what I will answer concerning my complaint.
\s1 The Righteous Shall Live by His Faith
\p
\v 2 And the \nd Lord\nd* answered me:
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Isa. 8:1; 30:8; [Rev. 1:19]\x*“Write the vision;
\q2 make it plain on tablets,
\q2 so he may run who reads it.
\q1
\v 3 For still \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Dan. 10:14]; See Ezek. 7:5-7 \x*the vision awaits its appointed time;
\q2 it hastens to the end—it will not lie.
\q1 If it seems slow, \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Zeph. 3:8; See Isa. 8:17 \x*wait for it;
\q2 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Cited Heb. 10:37; [2 Pet. 3:9]\x*it will surely come; it will not delay.
\b
\q1
\v 4 “Behold, his soul is puffed up; it is not upright within him,
\q2 but \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Cited Rom. 1:17; Gal. 3:11; Heb. 10:38; [John 3:36]\x*the righteous shall live by his faith.\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Or \fq faithfulness\f*
\b
\q1
\v 5 “Moreover, wine\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Masoretic Text; Dead Sea Scroll \fq wealth\f* is \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ch. 1:13; Isa. 21:2 \x*a traitor,
\q2 an arrogant man who is never at rest.\f + \fr 2:5 \ft The meaning of the Hebrew of these two lines is uncertain\f*
\q1 His greed is as wide as Sheol;
\q2 like death \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [Prov. 27:20] \x*he has never enough.
\q1 \x + \xo 2:5 \xt Jer. 27:7; [ch. 1:6; Dan. 2:37, 38]\x*He gathers for himself all nations
\q2 and collects as his own all peoples.”
\s1 Woe to the Chaldeans
\p
\v 6 Shall not all these \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Mic. 2:4; See Num. 23:7 \x*take up their taunt against him, with scoffing and riddles for him, and say,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt ver. 19; Isa. 5:8 \x*“Woe to him \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [ch. 1:6] \x*who heaps up what is not his own—
\q2 for \x + \xo 2:6 \xt See Zech. 1:12 \x*how long?—
\q2 and \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Ezek. 18:7]\x*loads himself with pledges!”
\q1
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7 \xt See Isa. 21:5-9\x*Will not your debtors suddenly arise,
\q2 and those awake who will make you tremble?
\q2 Then you will be spoil for them.
\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [Isa. 33:1] \x*Because you have plundered many nations,
\q2 all the remnant of the peoples shall plunder you,
\q1 \x + \xo 2:8 \xt ver. 17\x*for the blood of man and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt [Isa. 33:1] \x*violence to the earth,

\b
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*“Woe to him who gets evil gain for his house,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [Isa. 14:13] \x*to \x + \xo 2:9 \xt Jer. 49:16; [Num. 24:21]\x*set his nest on high,
\q2 to be safe from the reach of harm!
\q1
\v 10 You have devised shame for your house
\q2 \x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ch. 1:17]\x*by cutting off many peoples;
\q2 you have forfeited your life.
\q1
\v 11 For \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [Luke 19:40]\x*the stone will cry out from the wall,
\q2 and the beam from the woodwork respond.
\b
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*“Woe to him \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See Mic. 3:10\x*who builds a town with blood
\q2 and founds a city on iniquity!
\q1
\v 13 Behold, is it not from the \nd Lord\nd* of hosts
\q2 that \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Jer. 51:58\x*peoples labor merely for fire,
\q2 and nations weary themselves for nothing?
\q1
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Isa. 11:9 \x*For the earth will be filled
\q2 with the knowledge of \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Ps. 72:19\x*the glory of the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 as the waters cover the sea.
\b
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [See ver. 6 above] \x*“Woe to him \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [ver. 5; Jer. 51:7] \x*who makes his neighbors drink—
\q2 you pour out your wrath and make them drunk,
\q2 in order to gaze \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Lam. 4:21; [Gen. 9:22]\x*at their nakedness!
\q1
\v 16 You will have your fill \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Nah. 3:5 \x*of shame instead of glory.
\q2 \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Jer. 25:15, 26 \x*Drink, yourself, and show your uncircumcision!
\q1 \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Jer. 25:15, 26 \x*The cup in the \nd Lord\nd*’s right hand
\q2 will come around to you,
\q2 and \x + \xo 2:16 \xt [Nah. 3:6]\x*utter shame will come upon your glory!
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ver. 8 \x*The violence \x + \xo 2:17 \xt [Isa. 14:8; Jer. 22:23]\x*done to Lebanon will overwhelm you,
\q2 as will the destruction of the beasts that terrified them,
\q1 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ver. 8 \x*for the blood of man and violence to the earth,
\q2 to cities and all who dwell in them.
\b
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Isa. 44:10 \x*“What profit is an idol
\q2 when its maker has shaped it,
\q2 a metal image, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Jer. 10:8, 14; Zech. 10:2 \x*a teacher of lies?
\q1 For its maker trusts in his own creation
\q2 when he makes \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Ps. 115:5; 1 Cor. 12:2\x*speechless idols!
\q1
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19 \xt ver. 6, 9, 12, 15 \x*Woe to him \x + \xo 2:19 \xt See 1 Kgs. 18:26, 27 \x*who says to a wooden thing, Awake;
\q2 to a silent stone, Arise!
\q1 Can this teach?
\q1 Behold, it is overlaid with gold and silver,
\q2 and \x + \xo 2:19 \xt Ps. 135:17; Jer. 10:14\x*there is no breath at all in it.
\q1
\v 20 But \x + \xo 2:20 \xt Ps. 11:4; Mic. 1:2 \x*the \nd Lord\nd* is in his holy temple;
\q2 \x + \xo 2:20 \xt [Zeph. 1:7; Zech. 2:13]\x*let all the earth keep silence before him.”

\q1 His splendor covered the heavens,

\q1
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See Ezek. 1:27\x*His brightness was like the light;

\q1
\v 6 He stood \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [Ps. 60:6] \x*and measured the earth;

\q2 the everlasting hills sank low.
\q2 His were \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [Isa. 51:9]\x*the everlasting ways.
\q1
\v 7 I saw the tents of \x + \xo 3:7 \xt Judg. 3:8 \x*Cushan in affliction;
\q2 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt See Judg. 8:19-21\x*the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.
\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [Ps. 114:5] \x*Was your wrath against the rivers, O \nd Lord\nd*?
\q2 Was your anger against the rivers,

\q2 rejoicing as if to devour the poor in secret.
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [Ps. 77:19]\x*You trampled the sea with your horses,
