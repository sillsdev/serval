\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 1:29 \xt For ver. 29-34, see Matt. 8:14-16; Luke 4:38-41 \x*And immediately he\f + \fr 1:29 \ft Some manuscripts \fq they\f* \x + \xo 1:29 \xt ver. 21, 23\x*left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
\v 30 Now \x + \xo 1:30 \xt 1 Cor. 9:5\x*Simon’s mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.

\v 36 And Simon and those who were with him searched for him,
\v 37 and they found him and said to him, \x + \xo 1:37 \xt [John 12:19]\x*“Everyone is looking for you.”

\v 40 \x + \xo 1:40 \xt For ver. 40-44, see Matt. 8:2-4; Luke 5:12-14 \x*And a leper\f + \fr 1:40 \fq Leprosy \ft was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13\f* came to him, imploring him, and \x + \xo 1:40 \xt ch. 10:17; Matt. 17:14; 27:29 \x*kneeling said to him, \x + \xo 1:40 \xt [ch. 9:22, 23; Matt. 9:28]\x*“If you will, you can make me clean.”
\v 41 Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, \wj “I will; be clean.”\wj*
\v 42 And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.
\v 43 And \x + \xo 1:43 \xt Matt. 9:30\x*Jesus\f + \fr 1:43 \ft Greek \fq he\ft ; also verse 45\f* sternly charged him and sent him away at once,

\v 45 \x + \xo 1:45 \xt ch. 7:36; Matt. 9:31; [Luke 5:15, 16] \x*But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter \x + \xo 1:45 \xt 2 Cor. 11:26 \x*a town, but was out in \x + \xo 1:45 \xt 2 Cor. 11:26 \x*desolate places, and \x + \xo 1:45 \xt ch. 2:2, 13; 3:7; [John 6:2]\x*people were coming to him from every quarter.

\s1 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
\p \v 1 And when he returned to \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [Matt. 9:1]\x*Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home.
\v 2 And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them.
\v 3 \x + \xo 2:3 \xt For ver. 3-12, see Matt. 9:2-8; Luke 5:18-26\x*And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.
\v 4 And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [Luke 5:19]\x*they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay.
\v 5 And when Jesus \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ch. 10:52; Matt. 8:10, 13; 9:22, 29; 15:28; Luke 7:9, 50; 17:19; 18:42; Acts 3:16; 14:9; James 5:15 \x*saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, \wj “Son, \wj*\x + \xo 2:5 \xt Luke 7:48; [John 5:14]\x*\wj your sins are forgiven.”\wj*
\v 6 Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,
\v 7 “Why does this man speak like that? \x + \xo 2:7 \xt ch. 14:64; John 10:36 \x*He is blaspheming! \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Ps. 32:5; Isa. 43:25\x*Who can forgive sins but God alone?”
\v 8 And immediately Jesus, \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See John 2:25\x*perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, \wj “Why do you question these things in your hearts?\wj*
\v 9 \wj Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise, take up your bed and walk’?\wj*
\v 10 \wj But that you may know that \wj*\x + \xo 2:10 \xt [ver. 28]\x*\wj the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”\wj*—he said to the paralytic—
\v 11 \wj “I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home.”\wj*
\v 12 And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See Luke 7:16\x*glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”
\s1 Jesus Calls Levi
\p
\v 13 He went out again beside the sea, and \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See ch. 1:45\x*all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them.
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt For ver. 14-22, see Matt. 9:9-17; Luke 5:27-38 \x*And as he passed by, he saw \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Matt. 9:9]\x*Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, \wj “Follow me.”\wj* And he rose and followed him.
\p
\v 15 And as he reclined at table in his house, many \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Matt. 11:19; Luke 15:2\x*tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him.
\v 16 And \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Acts 4:5; 23:9 \x*the scribes of\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Some manuscripts \fq and\f* the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, \x + \xo 2:16 \xt [See ver. 15 above]\x*“Why does he eat\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq and drink\f* with tax collectors and sinners?”
\v 17 And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, \wj “Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. \wj*\x + \xo 2:17 \xt [Luke 15:7; John 9:39] \x*\wj I came not to call the righteous, \wj*\x + \xo 2:17 \xt 1 Tim. 1:15\x*\wj but sinners.”\wj*
\s1 A Question About Fasting

And people came and said to him, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt [ch. 7:5] \x*“Why do John’s disciples and \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Luke 18:12\x*the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”
\v 19 And Jesus said to them, \x + \xo 2:19 \xt John 3:29\x*\wj “Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.\wj*
\v 20 \x + \xo 2:20 \xt See Luke 17:22 \x*\wj The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and \wj*\x + \xo 2:20 \xt [John 16:20]\x*\wj then they will fast in that day.\wj*
\v 21 \wj No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.\wj*
\v 22 \wj And no one puts new wine into old \wj*\x + \xo 2:22 \xt Josh. 9:4\x*\wj wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins—and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins.”\wj*\f + \fr 2:22 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq But new wine is for fresh wineskins\f*

\v 24 And the Pharisees were saying to him, “Look, \x + \xo 2:24 \xt [Matt. 9:11] \x*why are they doing \x + \xo 2:24 \xt [Ex. 20:9-11]\x*what is not lawful on the Sabbath?”
\v 25 And he said to them, \x + \xo 2:25 \xt See Matt. 21:16 \x*\wj “Have you never read \wj*\x + \xo 2:25 \xt 1 Sam. 21:1-6\x*\wj what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:\wj*

\v 27 And he said to them, \x + \xo 2:27 \xt Ex. 23:12; Deut. 5:14 \x*\wj “The Sabbath was made for man, \wj*\x + \xo 2:27 \xt Col. 2:16\x*\wj not man for the Sabbath.\wj*

\v 4 And he said to them, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt [Luke 14:3]\x*\wj “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?”\wj* But they were silent.
\v 5 And he \x + \xo 3:5 \xt ver. 34; ch. 5:32; 10:23; [ch. 10:21] \x*looked around at them with anger, grieved at \x + \xo 3:5 \xt ch. 6:52; Rom. 11:25; Eph. 4:18 \x*their hardness of heart, and said to the man, \wj “Stretch out your hand.”\wj* \x + \xo 3:5 \xt [1 Kgs. 13:4]\x*He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.

\v 5 Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and cutting himself with stones.
\v 6 And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and \x + \xo 5:6 \xt See Matt. 8:2\x*fell down before him.
\v 7 And \x + \xo 5:7 \xt ch. 1:26; Acts 8:7 \x*crying out with a loud voice, he said, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, \x + \xo 5:7 \xt [Matt. 4:3, 6]; See Matt. 14:33 \x*Son of \x + \xo 5:7 \xt Gen. 14:18; Num. 24:16; Ps. 57:2; Dan. 3:26; Luke 1:32; 6:35; Acts 16:17 \x*the Most High God? \x + \xo 5:7 \xt Matt. 26:63; Acts 19:13; [James 2:19]\x*I adjure you by God, do not torment me.”

\v 11 Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside,
\v 12 and they begged him, saying, “Send us to the pigs; let us enter them.”
\v 13 So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the sea.

\v 27 She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.
\v 28 For she said, “If I touch even his garments, I will be made well.”
\v 29 \x + \xo 5:29 \xt Matt. 15:28; 17:18 \x*And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her \x + \xo 5:29 \xt See ch. 3:10\x*disease.

\v 36 But overhearing\f + \fr 5:36 \ft Or \fq ignoring\ft ; some manuscripts \fq hearing\f* what they said, Jesus said to \x + \xo 5:36 \xt [See ver. 35 above]\x*the ruler of the synagogue, \wj “Do not fear, only believe.”\wj*

\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14 \xt For ver. 14-29, see Matt. 14:1-12; Luke 9:7-9 \x*King Herod heard of it, for Jesus’\f + \fr 6:14 \ft Greek \fq his\f* name had become known.

\v 16 But when Herod heard of it, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised.”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17 \xt Luke 3:19, 20 \x*For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and \x + \xo 6:17 \xt Matt. 11:2; John 3:24\x*bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because he had married her.
\v 18 \x + \xo 6:18 \xt [See ver. 17 above] \x*For John had been saying to Herod, \x + \xo 6:18 \xt Lev. 18:16; 20:21\x*“It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.”
\v 19 And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not,
\v 20 for Herod \x + \xo 6:20 \xt [Matt. 14:5; 21:26] \x*feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he \x + \xo 6:20 \xt ch. 12:37; [ch. 4:16]\x*heard him gladly.
\p
\v 21 But an opportunity came when Herod \x + \xo 6:21 \xt Gen. 40:20 \x*on his birthday \x + \xo 6:21 \xt 1 Kgs. 3:15; Esth. 1:3; 2:18\x*gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee.
\v 22 For when Herodias’s daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you.”
\v 23 And he vowed to her, “Whatever you ask me, I will give you, \x + \xo 6:23 \xt Esth. 5:3; 7:2\x*up to half of my kingdom.”
\v 24 And she went out and said to her mother, “For what should I ask?” And she said, “The head of John the Baptist.”
\v 25 And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.”
\v 26 And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her.
\v 27 And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John’s\f + \fr 6:27 \ft Greek \fq his\f* head. He went and beheaded him in the prison
\v 28 and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
\v 29 When his \x + \xo 6:29 \xt See Matt. 9:14\x*disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb.

\v 39 Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass.
\v 40 So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.
\v 41 And taking the five loaves and the two fish he \x + \xo 6:41 \xt ch. 7:34; John 11:41; 17:1 \x*looked up to heaven and \x + \xo 6:41 \xt ch. 8:7; 14:22; 1 Sam. 9:13; Matt. 26:26; Luke 24:30; [1 Cor. 14:16]\x*said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people.

\v 71 But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know this man of whom you speak.”
\v 72 And immediately the rooster crowed \x + \xo 14:72 \xt ver. 68 \x*a second time.

\v 8 And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them.

\v 10 For he perceived that \x + \xo 15:10 \xt [John 12:19]\x*it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up.
\v 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead.

\v 23 And they offered him wine mixed with \x + \xo 15:23 \xt Matt. 2:11; See John 19:39\x*myrrh, but he did not take it.
\v 24 And they crucified him and \x + \xo 15:24 \xt Ps. 22:18\x*divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.

\v 2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.
\v 3 And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away \x + \xo 16:3 \xt ch. 15:46\x*the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”
