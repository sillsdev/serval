\p \v 1 Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile a narrative of the things that \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 2 Tim. 4:5, 17 (Gk.); [Acts 3:18]\x*have been accomplished among us,
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt [Heb. 2:3] \x*just as those who \x + \xo 1:2 \xt John 15:27; 16:4; [Mark 1:1; Acts 11:15] \x*from the beginning were \x + \xo 1:2 \xt 2 Pet. 1:16; 1 John 1:1, 3; [Acts 4:20; 1 Pet. 5:1] \x*eyewitnesses and \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Acts 26:16; 1 Cor. 4:1 \x*ministers of \x + \xo 1:2 \xt See Mark 4:14 \x*the word \x + \xo 1:2 \xt 1 Cor. 11:2, 23\x*have delivered them to us,
\v 3 it seemed good to me also, having followed all things closely for some time past, to write \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Acts 11:4 \x*an orderly account for you, \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Acts 23:26; 24:3; 26:25 \x*most excellent \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Acts 1:1\x*Theophilus,
\v 4 that you may have \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Acts 2:36 (Gk.); [2 Pet. 1:16, 19] \x*certainty concerning the things \x + \xo 1:4 \xt Acts 18:25; Rom. 2:18; 1 Cor. 14:19; Gal. 6:6 (Gk.)\x*you have been taught.
\s1 Birth of John the Baptist Foretold
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Matt. 2:1 \x*In the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Greek \fq Zacharias\f* \x + \xo 1:5 \xt 1 Chr. 24:10 \x*of \x + \xo 1:5 \xt ver. 8\x*the division of Abijah. And he had a wife from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
\v 6 And they were both \x + \xo 1:6 \xt ch. 2:25 \x*righteous before God, walking \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Phil. 2:15; 3:6; 1 Thess. 2:10; 3:13; 5:23; [Acts 23:1; 24:16]\x*blamelessly in all the commandments and statutes of the Lord.
\v 7 But they had no child, because \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ver. 36; [Judg. 13:2; 1 Sam. 1:2] \x*Elizabeth was barren, and \x + \xo 1:7 \xt [Gen. 18:11; Heb. 11:11, 12]\x*both were advanced in years.
\p
\v 8 Now \x + \xo 1:8 \xt 1 Chr. 24:19; 2 Chr. 8:14; 31:2; [ver. 23] \x*while he was serving as priest before God when \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ver. 5\x*his division was on duty,
\v 9 according to the custom of the priesthood, he was chosen by lot \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Ex. 30:7, 8; 1 Sam. 2:28; 1 Chr. 23:13; 2 Chr. 29:11 \x*to enter \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ver. 21, 22; Rev. 11:2, 19; [Heb. 9:2, 3]\x*the temple of the Lord and burn incense.
\v 10 And the whole multitude of the people \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Ps. 141:2; [Rev. 5:8; 8:3, 4] \x*were praying \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Lev. 16:17]\x*outside at the hour of incense.
\v 11 And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Ex. 30:1-10; 40:26, 27\x*the altar of incense.
\v 12 And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Acts 19:17\x*fear fell upon him.
\v 13 But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for \x + \xo 1:13 \xt [Acts 10:4, 31] \x*your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ver. 60, 63\x*you shall call his name John.
\v 14 And you will have joy and gladness, and many will \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [ver. 58]\x*rejoice at his birth,
\v 15 for he will be \x + \xo 1:15 \xt ch. 7:28; Matt. 11:11 \x*great before the Lord. And \x + \xo 1:15 \xt ch. 7:33; Num. 6:3; Judg. 13:4, 7, 14; Matt. 11:18 \x*he must not drink wine or strong \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Acts 2:15, 17; Eph. 5:18] \x*drink, and \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Acts 2:15, 17; Eph. 5:18] \x*he will be \x + \xo 1:15 \xt ver. 41, 67; See Acts 2:4 \x*filled with the Holy Spirit, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt Isa. 49:1, 5; Jer. 1:5; Gal. 1:15\x*even from his mother’s womb.
\v 16 And he will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God,
\v 17 and \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ver. 76; John 3:28 \x*he will go before him \x + \xo 1:17 \xt See Matt. 11:14 \x*in the spirit and power of Elijah, \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Cited from Mal. 4:6 \x*to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Rom. 10:21 \x*the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 7:27; Mal. 3:1; Matt. 11:10; Mark 1:2\x*to make ready for the Lord a people prepared.”
\p
\v 18 And Zechariah said to the angel, \x + \xo 1:18 \xt Gen. 15:8; [Gen. 17:17]\x*“How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.”
\v 19 And the angel answered him, “I am \x + \xo 1:19 \xt ver. 26; Dan. 8:16; 9:21 \x*Gabriel. \x + \xo 1:19 \xt Rev. 8:2; [1 Kgs. 17:1; Job 1:6; Isa. 63:9; Matt. 18:10]\x*I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.
\v 20 And behold, \x + \xo 1:20 \xt [Ezek. 3:26; 24:27]\x*you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”
\v 21 And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they were wondering at his delay in \x + \xo 1:21 \xt See ver. 9\x*the temple.
\v 22 And when he came out, he was unable to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in \x + \xo 1:22 \xt [See ver. 21 above] \x*the temple. And \x + \xo 1:22 \xt ver. 62\x*he kept making signs to them and remained mute.
\v 23 And \x + \xo 1:23 \xt 2 Chr. 23:8; [ver. 8; 2 Kgs. 11:5; 1 Chr. 9:25] \x*when his time of \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Heb. 10:11\x*service was ended, he went to his home.
\p
\v 24 After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived, and for five months she kept herself hidden, saying,
\v 25 “Thus the Lord has done for me in the days when he looked on me, \x + \xo 1:25 \xt [Gen. 30:23; 1 Sam. 1:6; Ps. 113:9; Isa. 4:1]\x*to take away my reproach among people.”
\s1 Birth of Jesus Foretold
\p
\v 26 In the sixth month the angel \x + \xo 1:26 \xt ver. 19 \x*Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named \x + \xo 1:26 \xt See Matt. 2:23\x*Nazareth,
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27 \xt Matt. 1:16, 18 \x*to a virgin betrothed\f + \fr 1:27 \ft That is, legally pledged to be married\f* to a man whose name was Joseph, \x + \xo 1:27 \xt ch. 2:4; Matt. 1:20\x*of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.
\v 28 And he came to her and said, “Greetings, \x + \xo 1:28 \xt [Ps. 45:2; Dan. 9:23] \x*O favored one, \x + \xo 1:28 \xt Judg. 6:12\x*the Lord is with you!”\f + \fr 1:28 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq Blessed are you among women!\f*
\v 29 But \x + \xo 1:29 \xt See ver. 12\x*she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.
\v 30 And the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for \x + \xo 1:30 \xt Acts 7:46\x*you have found favor with God.
\v 31 And behold, \x + \xo 1:31 \xt Isa. 7:14 \x*you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and \x + \xo 1:31 \xt ch. 2:21; Matt. 1:21, 25\x*you shall call his name Jesus.
\v 32 He will be great and will be called the Son of \x + \xo 1:32 \xt ver. 76; ch. 6:35; Acts 7:48; See Mark 5:7 \x*the Most High. And the Lord God \x + \xo 1:32 \xt ver. 69; 2 Sam. 7:11-13, 16; Ps. 89:4; 132:11; Isa. 9:6, 7; 16:5; Acts 2:30; [Rev. 3:7] \x*will give to him the throne of \x + \xo 1:32 \xt See Matt. 1:1\x*his father David,
\v 33 and he will reign over the house of Jacob \x + \xo 1:33 \xt Dan. 2:44; 7:14, 18, 27; Heb. 1:8; Rev. 11:15; [John 12:34]\x*forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”
\p
\v 34 And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I am a virgin?”\f + \fr 1:34 \ft Greek \fq since I do not know a man\f*
\p
\v 35 And the angel answered her, \x + \xo 1:35 \xt Matt. 1:18, 20 \x*“The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of \x + \xo 1:35 \xt [See ver. 32 above] \x*the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born\f + \fr 1:35 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq of you\f* will be called \x + \xo 1:35 \xt John 6:69 \x*holy—\x + \xo 1:35 \xt See Matt. 14:33\x*the Son of God.
\v 36 And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her \x + \xo 1:36 \xt ver. 7\x*who was called barren.
\v 37 For \x + \xo 1:37 \xt Cited from Gen. 18:14 (Gk.); See Matt. 19:26\x*nothing will be impossible with God.”
\v 38 And Mary said, “Behold, I am the servant\f + \fr 1:38 \ft Greek \fq bondservant\ft ; also verse 48\f* of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.” And \x + \xo 1:38 \xt [Judg. 6:21; Acts 12:10]\x*the angel departed from her.
\s1 Mary Visits Elizabeth
\p
\v 39 In those days Mary arose and went with haste into \x + \xo 1:39 \xt ver. 65; Josh. 20:7; 21:11\x*the hill country, to a town in Judah,
\v 40 and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.
\v 41 And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth \x + \xo 1:41 \xt ver. 15, 67\x*was filled with the Holy Spirit,
\v 42 and she exclaimed with a loud cry, \x + \xo 1:42 \xt [Judg. 5:24] \x*“Blessed are you among women, and \x + \xo 1:42 \xt [Deut. 28:4] \x*blessed is \x + \xo 1:42 \xt Ps. 127:3\x*the fruit of your womb!
\v 43 And why is this granted to me that the mother of \x + \xo 1:43 \xt ch. 20:42; John 20:28; [ch. 2:11]\x*my Lord should come to me?
\v 44 For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.
\v 45 And \x + \xo 1:45 \xt John 20:29; [ver. 20]\x*blessed is she who believed that there would be\f + \fr 1:45 \ft Or \fq believed, for there will be\f* a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”

\s1 The Birth of John the Baptist
\p
\v 57 Now the time came for Elizabeth to give birth, and she bore a son.
\v 58 And her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord \x + \xo 1:58 \xt Gen. 19:19\x*had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.

\s1 Jesus Calls the First Disciples
\p
\v 1 On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he was standing by \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Num. 34:11; Deut. 3:17; Josh. 12:3; John 6:1; [Matt. 14:34]\x*the lake of Gennesaret,

\v 3 Getting into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And \x + \xo 5:3 \xt [Matt. 5:1]\x*he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
\v 4 And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, \x + \xo 5:4 \xt [John 21:6]\x*\wj “Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.”\wj*
\v 5 And Simon answered, “Master, \x + \xo 5:5 \xt [John 21:3]\x*we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.”
\v 6 And when they had done this, \x + \xo 5:6 \xt [John 21:11]\x*they enclosed a large number of fish, and \x + \xo 5:6 \xt [John 21:11]\x*their nets were breaking.
\v 7 They signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. \x + \xo 5:7 \xt See John 21:4-8\x*And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink.

\v 9 For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken,
\v 10 and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, \wj “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching men.”\wj*\f + \fr 5:10 \ft The Greek word \+tl anthropoi\+tl* refers here to both men and women\f*
\v 11 And when they had brought their boats to land, \x + \xo 5:11 \xt ch. 18:28; Matt. 19:27; [ver. 28]\x*they left everything and followed him.

\v 12 While he was in one of the cities, \x + \xo 5:12 \xt For ver. 12-14, see Matt. 8:2-4; Mark 1:40-44 \x*there came a man full of leprosy.\f + \fr 5:12 \fq Leprosy \ft was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13\f* And when he saw Jesus, he \x + \xo 5:12 \xt See ch. 17:16 \x*fell on his face and begged him, “Lord, \x + \xo 5:12 \xt [Matt. 9:28; Mark 9:22, 23]\x*if you will, you can make me clean.”
\v 13 And Jesus\f + \fr 5:13 \ft Greek \fq he\f* stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, \wj “I will; be clean.”\wj* And immediately the leprosy left him.

\s1 A Sinful Woman Forgiven
\p
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36 \xt ch. 11:37; 14:1\x*One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37 \xt For ver. 37-39, [Matt. 26:6-13; Mark 14:3-9; John 12:1-8]\x*And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment,
\v 38 and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and \x + \xo 7:38 \xt ver. 44; John 11:2\x*wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
\v 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “If \x + \xo 7:39 \xt [ch. 15:2] \x*this man were \x + \xo 7:39 \xt ver. 16; John 4:19 \x*a prophet, he \x + \xo 7:39 \xt [ch. 22:64]\x*would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.”
\v 40 And Jesus answering said to him, \wj “Simon, I have something to say to you.”\wj* And he answered, “Say it, Teacher.”
\p
\v 41 \wj “A certain moneylender had two debtors. One owed five hundred \wj*\x + \xo 7:41 \xt See Matt. 18:28\x*\wj denarii, and the other fifty.\wj*
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42 \xt Matt. 18:25 \x*\wj When they could not pay, he \wj*\x + \xo 7:42 \xt [Rom. 8:32 (Gk.)]\x*\wj cancelled the debt of both. Now which of them will love him more?”\wj*
\v 43 Simon answered, “The one, I suppose, for whom he cancelled the larger debt.” And he said to him, \wj “You have judged rightly.”\wj*
\v 44 Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, \wj “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; \wj*\x + \xo 7:44 \xt 1 Tim. 5:10; See Gen. 18:4 \x*\wj you gave me no water for my feet, but \wj*\x + \xo 7:44 \xt ver. 38\x*\wj she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.\wj*

\v 46 \x + \xo 7:46 \xt Ps. 23:5; 141:5; Eccles. 9:8; Matt. 6:17\x*\wj You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.\wj*
\v 47 \wj Therefore I tell you, her sins, \wj*\x + \xo 7:47 \xt [ver. 39]\x*\wj which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.”\wj*
\v 48 And he said to her, \x + \xo 7:48 \xt ch. 5:20; Matt. 9:2; Mark 2:5; James 5:15; 1 John 2:12; [John 20:23]\x*\wj “Your sins are forgiven.”\wj*

\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 8:4 \xt For ver. 4-10, see Matt. 13:1-15; Mark 4:1-12\x*And when a great crowd was gathering and people from town after town came to him, he said in a parable,
\v 5 \x + \xo 8:5 \xt [Isa. 55:10; Amos 9:13]\x*\wj “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled underfoot, and the birds of the air devoured it.\wj*
\v 6 \wj And some fell on the rock, and as it grew up, \wj*\x + \xo 8:6 \xt John 15:6\x*\wj it withered away, because it had no moisture.\wj*
\v 7 \wj And some fell among \wj*\x + \xo 8:7 \xt Jer. 4:3\x*\wj thorns, and the thorns grew up with it and choked it.\wj*
\v 8 \wj And some fell into good soil and grew and yielded \wj*\x + \xo 8:8 \xt Gen. 26:12 \x*\wj a hundredfold.”\wj* As he said these things, he called out, \x + \xo 8:8 \xt See Matt. 11:15\x*\wj “He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”\wj*
\s1 The Purpose of the Parables
\p
\v 9 And when his disciples asked him what this parable meant,
\v 10 he said, \x + \xo 8:10 \xt Matt. 19:11; Col. 1:27; [1 Cor. 2:6-10; 1 John 2:20, 27]; See Matt. 11:25 \x*\wj “To you it has been given to know \wj*\x + \xo 8:10 \xt See Rom. 16:25 \x*\wj the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so \wj*\x + \xo 8:10 \xt Isa. 6:9, 10; See Matt. 13:13\x*\wj that ‘seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.’\wj*
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11 \xt For ver. 11-15, see Matt. 13:18-23; Mark 4:13-20 \x*\wj Now the parable is this: The seed is \wj*\x + \xo 8:11 \xt ch. 1:2; Mark 2:2; 4:33; Acts 8:4; James 1:21\x*\wj the word of God.\wj*
\v 12 \wj The ones along the path are those who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not \wj*\x + \xo 8:12 \xt See Mark 16:16\x*\wj believe and be saved.\wj*
\v 13 \wj And the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear the word, receive it \wj*\x + \xo 8:13 \xt [Isa. 58:2; Ezek. 33:31, 32; Mark 6:20; John 5:35] \x*\wj with joy. But these have no root; they \wj*\x + \xo 8:13 \xt Gal. 1:6; [Hos. 6:4; Gal. 5:7] \x*\wj believe for a while, and in time of testing \wj*\x + \xo 8:13 \xt 1 Tim. 4:1; Heb. 3:12\x*\wj fall away.\wj*
\v 14 \wj And as for what fell among the thorns, they are those who hear, but \wj*\x + \xo 8:14 \xt [James 1:11] \x*\wj as they go on their way they are choked by the \wj*\x + \xo 8:14 \xt See Matt. 6:25\x*\wj cares and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature.\wj*
\v 15 \wj As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and good heart, and \wj*\x + \xo 8:15 \xt Hos. 14:8; John 15:5, 6; Phil. 1:11; Col. 1:6 \x*\wj bear fruit \wj*\x + \xo 8:15 \xt James 5:7; See Heb. 10:36\x*\wj with patience.\wj*

\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17 \xt ch. 12:2; Matt. 10:26; [1 Tim. 5:25]\x*\wj For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.\wj*

\s1 Jesus’ Mother and Brothers
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 8:19 \xt For ver. 19-21, see Matt. 12:46-50; Mark 3:31-35 \x*Then his mother and \x + \xo 8:19 \xt Matt. 13:55; Mark 6:3; John 2:12; 7:3, 5, 10; Acts 1:14; 1 Cor. 9:5; Gal. 1:19\x*his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him because of the crowd.
\v 20 And he was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.”
\v 21 But he answered them, \wj “My mother and my brothers are those \wj*\x + \xo 8:21 \xt ch. 11:28; See James 1:22\x*\wj who hear the word of God and do it.”\wj*
\s1 Jesus Calms a Storm
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 8:22 \xt For ver. 22-25, see Matt. 8:23-27; Mark 4:36-41; [John 6:16-21] \x*One day he got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, \wj “Let us go across to the other side of \wj*\x + \xo 8:22 \xt ver. 33; See ch. 5:1\x*\wj the lake.”\wj* So they set out,
\v 23 and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on \x + \xo 8:23 \xt [See ver. 22 above]\x*the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger.
\v 24 And they went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he awoke and \x + \xo 8:24 \xt ch. 4:39; Ps. 104:7 \x*rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, \x + \xo 8:24 \xt Ps. 65:7; [Matt. 14:32; Mark 6:51]\x*and there was a calm.
\v 25 He said to them, \wj “Where is your faith?”\wj* And they \x + \xo 8:25 \xt John 14:27 \x*were afraid, and they \x + \xo 8:25 \xt [Mark 1:27] \x*marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that \x + \xo 8:25 \xt [ch. 5:9]\x*he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?”
\s1 Jesus Heals a Man with a Demon
\p
\v 26 \x + \xo 8:26 \xt For ver. 26-40, see Matt. 8:28–9:1; Mark 5:1-21\x*Then they sailed to the country of the Gerasenes,\f + \fr 8:26 \ft Some manuscripts \fq Gadarenes\ft ; others \fq Gergesenes\ft ; also verse 37\f* which is opposite Galilee.
\v 27 When Jesus\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Greek \fq he\ft ; also verses 38, 42\f* had stepped out on land, there met him a man from the city who had demons. For a long time he had worn no clothes, and he had not lived in a house \x + \xo 8:27 \xt [Rev. 18:2]\x*but among the tombs.
\v 28 When he saw Jesus, he \x + \xo 8:28 \xt ch. 4:33, 34; Mark 1:23, 24, 26; Acts 8:7 \x*cried out and fell down before him and said \x + \xo 8:28 \xt ch. 4:33, 34; Mark 1:23, 24, 26; Acts 8:7 \x*with a loud voice, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, \x + \xo 8:28 \xt [ch. 4:3, 9]; See Matt. 14:33 \x*Son of \x + \xo 8:28 \xt ch. 1:32; 6:35; Gen. 14:18; Num. 24:16; Ps. 57:2; Isa. 14:14; Dan. 3:26; Acts 16:17\x*the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me.”
\v 29 For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For many a time it had seized him. He was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, but he would break the bonds and be driven by the demon \x + \xo 8:29 \xt [ch. 11:24; Matt. 12:43]\x*into the desert.)
\v 30 Jesus then asked him, \wj “What is your name?”\wj* And he said, \x + \xo 8:30 \xt Matt. 26:53\x*“Legion,” for many demons had entered him.
\v 31 And they begged him not to command them to depart into \x + \xo 8:31 \xt See Rev. 9:1\x*the abyss.
\v 32 Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and they begged him to let them enter these. So he gave them permission.
\v 33 Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into \x + \xo 8:33 \xt ver. 22, 23\x*the lake and drowned.
\p
\v 34 When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and told it in the city and in the country.
\v 35 Then people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone, sitting \x + \xo 8:35 \xt ch. 10:39 \x*at the feet of Jesus, \x + \xo 8:35 \xt [ver. 27]\x*clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid.
\v 36 And those who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed\f + \fr 8:36 \ft Greek \+tl daimonizomai\+tl*; elsewhere rendered \fq oppressed by demons\f* man had been healed.
\v 37 Then all the people of the surrounding country of the Gerasenes \x + \xo 8:37 \xt [ch. 5:8; Acts 16:39]\x*asked him to depart from them, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.
\v 38 The man from whom the demons had gone begged that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
\v 39 \wj “Return to your home, and \wj*\x + \xo 8:39 \xt Ps. 66:16; [ch. 5:14]\x*\wj declare how much God has done for you.”\wj* And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
\s1 Jesus Heals a Woman and Jairus’s Daughter
\p
\v 40 Now when Jesus returned, the crowd \x + \xo 8:40 \xt ch. 9:11\x*welcomed him, for they were all waiting for him.
\v 41 \x + \xo 8:41 \xt For ver. 41-56, see Matt. 9:18-26; Mark 5:22-43 \x*And there came a man named Jairus, who was \x + \xo 8:41 \xt ch. 13:14; Acts 13:15; 18:8, 17\x*a ruler of the synagogue. And falling at Jesus’ feet, he implored him to come to his house,
\v 42 for he had \x + \xo 8:42 \xt See ch. 7:12 \x*an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she was dying.
\p As Jesus went, the people \x + \xo 8:42 \xt ver. 45; Mark 3:9\x*pressed around him.
\v 43 And there was a woman \x + \xo 8:43 \xt Lev. 15:25 \x*who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, and though she had spent all her \x + \xo 8:43 \xt ch. 21:4; Mark 12:44\x*living on physicians,\f + \fr 8:43 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq and though she had spent all her living on physicians,\f* she could not be healed by anyone.
\v 44 She came up behind him and touched \x + \xo 8:44 \xt Matt. 14:36; 23:5; [Num. 15:38, 39; Deut. 22:12] \x*the fringe of his garment, and \x + \xo 8:44 \xt Matt. 15:28; 17:18\x*immediately her discharge of blood ceased.
\v 45 And Jesus said, \wj “Who was it that touched me?”\wj* When all denied it, Peter\f + \fr 8:45 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq and those who were with him\f* said, “Master, the crowds surround you and are pressing in on you!”
\v 46 But Jesus said, \wj “Someone touched me, for I perceive that \wj*\x + \xo 8:46 \xt ch. 5:17; 6:19; [Acts 10:38]\x*\wj power has gone out from me.”\wj*
\v 47 And when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling, and falling down before him declared in the presence of all the people why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed.
\v 48 And he said to her, \wj “Daughter, \wj*\x + \xo 8:48 \xt See ch. 7:50\x*\wj your faith has made you well; \wj*\x + \xo 8:48 \xt See ch. 7:50\x*\wj go in peace.”\wj*
\p
\v 49 While he was still speaking, someone from \x + \xo 8:49 \xt ver. 41 \x*the ruler’s house came and said, “Your daughter is dead; \x + \xo 8:49 \xt ch. 7:6 \x*do not trouble \x + \xo 8:49 \xt See John 11:28\x*the Teacher any more.”
\v 50 But Jesus on hearing this answered him, \wj “Do not fear; only believe, and she will be well.”\wj*
\v 51 And when he came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him, except \x + \xo 8:51 \xt ch. 9:28; Mark 14:33 \x*Peter and \x + \xo 8:51 \xt Mark 3:17\x*John and James, and the father and mother of the child.
\v 52 And all were weeping and \x + \xo 8:52 \xt ch. 23:27; Matt. 11:17 \x*mourning for her, but he \x + \xo 8:52 \xt ch. 7:13 \x*said, \wj “Do not weep, for \wj*\x + \xo 8:52 \xt [Acts 20:10] \x*\wj she is not dead but \wj*\x + \xo 8:52 \xt John 11:4, 11\x*\wj sleeping.”\wj*
\v 53 And they laughed at him, knowing that she was dead.
\v 54 But \x + \xo 8:54 \xt See Mark 1:31 \x*taking her by the hand he called, saying, \wj “Child, \wj*\x + \xo 8:54 \xt ch. 7:14, 22; [Matt. 11:5; John 11:43]\x*\wj arise.”\wj*
\v 55 And \x + \xo 8:55 \xt [Judg. 15:19; 1 Sam. 30:12]\x*her spirit returned, and she got up at once. And he directed that something should be given her to eat.

\p
\v 10 On their return \x + \xo 9:10 \xt Mark 6:30 \x*the apostles told him all that they had done. \x + \xo 9:10 \xt For ver. 10-17, see Matt. 14:13-21; Mark 6:32-44; John 6:1-13; [Matt. 15:32-38; Mark 8:2-9]\x*And he took them and withdrew apart to a town called Bethsaida.

\v 1 One Sabbath, \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 7:36; 11:37 \x*when he went to dine at the house of a ruler of the Pharisees, they were \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 20:20; Mark 3:2\x*watching him carefully.
\v 2 And behold, there was a man before him who had dropsy.
\v 3 And Jesus responded to \x + \xo 14:3 \xt See ch. 7:30 \x*the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, \x + \xo 14:3 \xt ch. 13:14; Matt. 12:10\x*\wj “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath, or not?”\wj*
\v 4 But they remained silent. Then he took him and healed him and sent him away.
\v 5 And he said to them, \x + \xo 14:5 \xt ch. 13:15; [Deut. 22:4; Matt. 12:11]\x*\wj “Which of you, having a son\wj*\f + \fr 14:5 \ft Some manuscripts \fq a donkey\f*\wj or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?”\wj*
\v 6 \x + \xo 14:6 \xt [Matt. 22:46]\x*And they could not reply to these things.
\s1 The Parable of the Wedding Feast
\p
\v 7 Now he told a parable to those who were invited, when he noticed \x + \xo 14:7 \xt See ch. 11:43\x*how they chose the places of honor, saying to them,
\v 8 \wj “When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not sit down in a place of honor, lest someone more distinguished than you be invited by him,\wj*
\v 9 \wj and he who invited you both will come and say to you, ‘Give your place to this person,’ and then you will begin with shame to take the lowest place.\wj*
\v 10 \wj But when you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place, \wj*\x + \xo 14:10 \xt Prov. 25:6, 7\x*\wj so that when your host comes he may say to you, ‘Friend, move up higher.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you.\wj*
\v 11 \wj For \wj*\x + \xo 14:11 \xt ch. 18:14; [Prov. 29:23; Ezek. 21:26; Matt. 18:4; James 4:6, 10; 1 Pet. 5:5, 6]\x*\wj everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted.”\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Great Banquet
\p
\v 12 He said also to the man who had invited him, \wj “When you give \wj*\x + \xo 14:12 \xt John 21:12 (Gk.) \x*\wj a dinner or a banquet, do not invite your friends or your brothers\wj*\f + \fr 14:12 \ft Or \fq your brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to \fq brothers \ft or to \fq brothers and sisters\f*\wj or your relatives or rich neighbors, \wj*\x + \xo 14:12 \xt [ch. 6:34]\x*\wj lest they also invite you in return and you be repaid.\wj*
\v 13 \wj But when you give a feast, \wj*\x + \xo 14:13 \xt [Neh. 8:10, 12; Esth. 9:22] \x*\wj invite \wj*\x + \xo 14:13 \xt ver. 21\x*\wj the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind,\wj*
\v 14 \wj and you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you. For you will be repaid \wj*\x + \xo 14:14 \xt 1 Cor. 15:23; 1 Thess. 4:16; [John 11:24; Rev. 20:4, 5] \x*\wj at \wj*\x + \xo 14:14 \xt Acts 24:15\x*\wj the resurrection of the just.”\wj*
\p
\v 15 When one of those who reclined at table with him heard these things, he said to him, \x + \xo 14:15 \xt Rev. 19:9 \x*“Blessed is everyone who will \x + \xo 14:15 \xt [ch. 13:29; 22:16, 30]\x*eat bread in the kingdom of God!”
\v 16 But he said to him, \x + \xo 14:16 \xt For ver. 16-24, [Matt. 22:2-14] \x*\wj “A man once \wj*\x + \xo 14:16 \xt [Isa. 25:6]\x*\wj gave a great banquet and invited many.\wj*
\v 17 \wj And at the time for the banquet he \wj*\x + \xo 14:17 \xt [Esth. 6:14; Prov. 9:3, 5]\x*\wj sent his servant\wj*\f + \fr 14:17 \ft Greek \fq bondservant\ft ; also verses 21, 22, 23\f*\wj to say to those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’\wj*
\v 18 \wj But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please have me excused.’\wj*
\v 19 \wj And another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to examine them. Please have me excused.’\wj*
\v 20 \wj And another said, \wj*\x + \xo 14:20 \xt Deut. 24:5\x*\wj ‘I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.’\wj*
\v 21 \wj So the servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and said to his servant, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in \wj*\x + \xo 14:21 \xt ver. 13\x*\wj the poor and crippled and blind and lame.’\wj*
\v 22 \wj And the servant said, ‘Sir, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.’\wj*
\v 23 \wj And the master said to the servant, ‘Go out to the highways and hedges and compel people to come in, that my house may be filled.\wj*
\v 24 \wj For I tell you,\wj*\f + \fr 14:24 \ft The Greek word for \fq you \ft here is plural\f*\x + \xo 14:24 \xt Matt. 21:43; Acts 13:46\x*\wj none of those men who were invited shall taste my banquet.’”\wj*
\s1 The Cost of Discipleship
\p
\v 25 Now great crowds accompanied him, and he turned and said to them,
\v 26 \x + \xo 14:26 \xt ver. 33; Matt. 10:37; [Deut. 33:9] \x*\wj “If anyone comes to me and \wj*\x + \xo 14:26 \xt ch. 16:13 \x*\wj does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, \wj*\x + \xo 14:26 \xt John 12:25; Acts 20:24; Rev. 12:11\x*\wj yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 14:27 \xt ch. 9:23; Matt. 10:38; 16:24; Mark 8:34 \x*\wj Whoever does not \wj*\x + \xo 14:27 \xt John 19:17\x*\wj bear his own cross and come after me cannot be my disciple.\wj*
\v 28 \wj For which of you, desiring to build a tower, does not \wj*\x + \xo 14:28 \xt [Prov. 24:27]\x*\wj first sit down and count the cost, whether he has enough to complete it?\wj*
\v 29 \wj Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him,\wj*
\v 30 \wj saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish.’\wj*
\v 31 \wj Or what king, going out to encounter another king in war, will not \wj*\x + \xo 14:31 \xt ver. 28\x*\wj sit down first and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?\wj*
\v 32 \wj And if not, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks for terms of peace.\wj*
\v 33 \x + \xo 14:33 \xt [Phil. 3:7] \x*\wj So therefore, any one of you who \wj*\x + \xo 14:33 \xt [ver. 26; ch. 18:28]\x*\wj does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple.\wj*
\s1 Salt Without Taste Is Worthless
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 14:34 \xt Mark 9:50 \x*\wj “Salt is good, \wj*\x + \xo 14:34 \xt Matt. 5:13\x*\wj but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored?\wj*
\v 35 \wj It is of no use either for the soil or for the manure pile. It is thrown away. \wj*\x + \xo 14:35 \xt See Matt. 11:15\x*\wj He who has ears to hear, let him hear.”\wj*
\c 15
\s1 The Parable of the Lost Sheep
\p
\v 1 Now \x + \xo 15:1 \xt See Matt. 11:19\x*the tax collectors and sinners were all drawing near to hear him.
\v 2 And the Pharisees and the scribes \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 19:7; [Ex. 16:2, 7, 8; Num. 14:2; Josh. 9:18] \x*grumbled, saying, \x + \xo 15:2 \xt [ch. 7:39] \x*“This man receives sinners and \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 5:30; Matt. 9:11; 11:19; Mark 2:16; [Acts 11:3; 1 Cor. 5:11; Gal. 2:12]\x*eats with them.”
\p
\v 3 So he told them this parable:
\v 4 \x + \xo 15:4 \xt For ver. 4-7, [Matt. 18:12-14] \x*\wj “What man of you, having a hundred sheep, \wj*\x + \xo 15:4 \xt Ezek. 34:6; [1 Pet. 2:25] \x*\wj if he has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine \wj*\x + \xo 15:4 \xt [Ex. 3:1; 1 Sam. 17:28] \x*\wj in the open country, and \wj*\x + \xo 15:4 \xt Ezek. 34:4, 11, 12, 16; [ch. 19:10]\x*\wj go after the one that is lost, until he finds it?\wj*
\v 5 \wj And when he has found it, \wj*\x + \xo 15:5 \xt [Isa. 40:11; 49:22; 60:4; 66:12]\x*\wj he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.\wj*
\v 6 \wj And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them, ‘Rejoice with me, for \wj*\x + \xo 15:6 \xt 1 Pet. 2:25\x*\wj I have found my sheep that was lost.’\wj*
\v 7 \wj Just so, I tell you, there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who \wj*\x + \xo 15:7 \xt ver. 10; See ch. 5:32 \x*\wj repents than over ninety-nine \wj*\x + \xo 15:7 \xt [ch. 5:32; Matt. 9:13]\x*\wj righteous persons who need no repentance.\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Lost Coin
\p
\v 8 \wj “Or what woman, having ten silver coins,\wj*\f + \fr 15:8 \ft Greek \fq ten \+tl drachmas\+tl*; a \+tl drachma\+tl* was a Greek coin approximately equal in value to a Roman \+tl denarius\+tl*, worth about a day’s wage for a laborer\f*\wj if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?\wj*
\v 9 \wj And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’\wj*
\v 10 \wj Just so, I tell you, there is joy before \wj*\x + \xo 15:10 \xt See ch. 12:8\x*\wj the angels of God over one sinner who repents.”\wj*
\s1 The Parable of the Prodigal Son
\p
\v 11 And he said, \wj “There was a man who had two sons.\wj*
\v 12 \wj And the younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me \wj*\x + \xo 15:12 \xt Deut. 21:17 \x*\wj the share of property that is coming to me.’ And he divided \wj*\x + \xo 15:12 \xt ver. 30; Mark 12:44\x*\wj his property between them.\wj*
\v 13 \wj Not many days later, the younger son gathered all he had and took a journey into a far country, and there he squandered his property in \wj*\x + \xo 15:13 \xt [Eph. 5:18; Titus 1:6; 1 Pet. 4:4]\x*\wj reckless living.\wj*
\v 14 \wj And when he had spent everything, a severe famine arose in that country, and he began to be in need.\wj*

\p
\v 17 \wj “But \wj*\x + \xo 15:17 \xt [1 Kgs. 8:47] \x*\wj when he \wj*\x + \xo 15:17 \xt [Acts 12:11]\x*\wj came to himself, he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired servants have more than enough bread, but I perish here with hunger!\wj*

\v 20 \wj And he arose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and felt compassion, and \wj*\x + \xo 15:20 \xt [James 4:8] \x*\wj ran and \wj*\x + \xo 15:20 \xt Gen. 33:4; Acts 20:37 \x*\wj embraced him and \wj*\x + \xo 15:20 \xt 2 Sam. 14:33\x*\wj kissed him.\wj*

\v 25 \wj “Now his older son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.\wj*

\v 27 \wj And he said to him, ‘Your brother has come, and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he has received him back safe and sound.’\wj*
\v 28 \wj But he was angry and refused to go in. His father came out and entreated him,\wj*

\s1 The Parable of the Dishonest Manager
\p
\v 1 He also said to the disciples, \wj “There was a rich man who had \wj*\x + \xo 16:1 \xt ch. 12:42\x*\wj a manager, and charges were brought to him that this man was wasting his possessions.\wj*

\v 3 \wj And the manager said to himself, ‘What shall I do, since my master is taking the management away from me? I am not strong enough to dig, and I am ashamed to beg.\wj*
\v 4 \wj I have decided what to do, so that when I am removed from management, people may receive me into their houses.’\wj*
\v 5 \wj So, summoning his master’s debtors one by one, he said to the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’\wj*

\s1 The Parable of the Ten Minas

\v 12 He said therefore, \x + \xo 19:12 \xt For ver. 12-27, [Matt. 25:14-30; Mark 13:34]\x*\wj “A nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return.\wj*

\v 14 \wj But \wj*\x + \xo 19:14 \xt [John 1:14]\x*\wj his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to reign over us.’\wj*
\v 15 \wj When he returned, having received the kingdom, he ordered these servants to whom he had given the money to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by doing business.\wj*
\v 16 \wj The first came before him, saying, ‘Lord, your mina has made ten minas more.’\wj*
\v 17 \wj And he said to him, ‘Well done, good servant!\wj*\f + \fr 19:17 \ft Greek \fq bondservant\ft ; also verse 22\f*\wj Because you have been \wj*\x + \xo 19:17 \xt ch. 16:10; 1 Cor. 4:2; [1 Tim. 3:13] \x*\wj faithful in a very little, \wj*\x + \xo 19:17 \xt [Matt. 24:47]\x*\wj you shall have authority over ten cities.’\wj*

\v 23 \wj Why then did you not put my money in the bank, and at my coming I might have collected it with interest?’\wj*
\v 24 \wj And he said to those who stood by, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has the ten minas.’\wj*

\v 31 \wj If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you shall say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’”\wj*

\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 20:9 \xt For ver. 9-19, see Matt. 21:33-46; Mark 12:1-12 \x*And he began to tell the people this parable: \wj “A man planted \wj*\x + \xo 20:9 \xt Ps. 80:8; Isa. 5:1; Matt. 21:28 \x*\wj a vineyard and \wj*\x + \xo 20:9 \xt Song 8:11, 12 \x*\wj let it out to tenants and \wj*\x + \xo 20:9 \xt Matt. 25:14, 15; [Mark 13:34]\x*\wj went into another country for a long while.\wj*

\v 47 \x + \xo 22:47 \xt For ver. 47-53, see Matt. 26:47-56; Mark 14:43-50; John 18:3-11 \x*While he was still speaking, there came a crowd, and the man called \x + \xo 22:47 \xt ver. 3\x*Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He drew near to Jesus to kiss him,
\v 48 but Jesus said to him, \wj “Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”\wj*
\v 49 And when those who were around him saw what would follow, they said, “Lord, shall we strike \x + \xo 22:49 \xt ver. 38\x*with the sword?”
\v 50 And one of them struck the servant\f + \fr 22:50 \ft Greek \fq bondservant\f* of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
\v 51 But Jesus said, \wj “No more of this!”\wj* And he touched his ear and healed him.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to the chief priests and \x + \xo 22:52 \xt See ver. 4\x*officers of the temple and elders, who had come out against him, \wj “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?\wj*
\v 53 \wj When \wj*\x + \xo 22:53 \xt [John 8:2]; [ch. 2:46; John 18:20] \x*\wj I was with you day after day in the temple, you did not lay hands on me. But this is \wj*\x + \xo 22:53 \xt [Mark 14:35, 41; John 12:27; 16:4] \x*\wj your hour, and \wj*\x + \xo 22:53 \xt Eph. 6:12; [Acts 26:18]\x*\wj the power of darkness.”\wj*
\s1 Peter Denies Jesus
\p
\v 54 \x + \xo 22:54 \xt Matt. 26:57; Mark 14:53 \x*Then they seized him and led him away, bringing him into the high priest’s house, \x + \xo 22:54 \xt Matt. 26:58; Mark 14:54; John 18:15\x*and Peter was following at a distance.
\v 55 \x + \xo 22:55 \xt For ver. 55-62, see Matt. 26:69-75; Mark 14:66-72; John 18:16-18, 25-27 \x*And when they had kindled a fire in the middle of \x + \xo 22:55 \xt See Matt. 26:3\x*the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them.
\v 56 Then a servant girl, seeing him as he sat in the light and looking closely at him, said, “This man also was with him.”
\v 57 But he denied it, saying, “Woman, I do not know him.”
\v 58 And a little later someone else saw him and said, “You also are one of them.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not.”
\v 59 And after an interval of about an hour still another \x + \xo 22:59 \xt Acts 12:15\x*insisted, saying, “Certainly this man also was with him, for he too is a Galilean.”
\v 60 But Peter said, “Man, I do not know what you are talking about.” And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
\v 61 And the Lord turned and \x + \xo 22:61 \xt See Mark 10:21 \x*looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the saying of the Lord, how he had said to him, \x + \xo 22:61 \xt ver. 34 \x*\wj “Before the rooster crows today, you will \wj*\x + \xo 22:61 \xt [Acts 3:13, 14]\x*\wj deny me three times.”\wj*
\v 62 And he went out and wept bitterly.
\s1 Jesus Is Mocked
\p
\v 63 \x + \xo 22:63 \xt [Matt. 26:67, 68; Mark 14:65; John 18:22, 23]\x*Now the men who were holding Jesus in custody were mocking him as they beat him.
\v 64 \x + \xo 22:64 \xt [See ver. 63 above] \x*They also blindfolded him and kept asking him, \x + \xo 22:64 \xt [ch. 7:39]\x*“Prophesy! \x + \xo 22:64 \xt [ch. 7:39]\x*Who is it that struck you?”
\v 65 And they said many other things against him, \x + \xo 22:65 \xt See Matt. 27:39\x*blaspheming him.
\s1 Jesus Before the Council
\p
\v 66 \x + \xo 22:66 \xt Matt. 27:1; Mark 15:1; John 18:28 \x*When day came, \x + \xo 22:66 \xt Acts 22:5 (Gk.) \x*the assembly of the elders of the people gathered together, both chief priests and scribes. And they led him away to their \x + \xo 22:66 \xt See Matt. 5:22 \x*council, and they \x + \xo 22:66 \xt For ver. 67-71, [Matt. 26:63-66; Mark 14:61-64; John 18:19-21]\x*said,
\v 67 \x + \xo 22:67 \xt John 10:24, 25 \x*“If you are \x + \xo 22:67 \xt See Matt. 1:17\x*the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, \wj “If I tell you, you will not believe,\wj*
\v 68 \wj and if I ask you, you will not answer.\wj*
\v 69 \wj But from now on the Son of Man shall be seated \wj*\x + \xo 22:69 \xt Mark 16:19; Acts 7:56; Heb. 1:3\x*\wj at the right hand of the power of God.”\wj*
\v 70 So they all said, “Are you \x + \xo 22:70 \xt See Matt. 14:33 \x*the Son of God, then?” And he said to them, \x + \xo 22:70 \xt ch. 23:3; Matt. 27:11; Mark 15:2; [Matt. 26:25]\x*\wj “You say that I am.”\wj*
\v 71 Then they said, “What further testimony do we need? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips.”
\c 23
\s1 Jesus Before Pilate
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 23:1 \xt Matt. 27:2; Mark 15:1; John 18:28\x*Then the whole company of them arose and brought him before Pilate.
\v 2 And they began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man \x + \xo 23:2 \xt ver. 14; [Acts 17:6, 7; 24:5] \x*misleading our nation and \x + \xo 23:2 \xt [ch. 20:25] \x*forbidding us to give tribute to \x + \xo 23:2 \xt ch. 2:1; 3:1 \x*Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, \x + \xo 23:2 \xt John 18:33, 36, 37; 19:12; [Acts 17:7]\x*a king.”
\v 3 \x + \xo 23:3 \xt Matt. 27:11; Mark 15:2 \x*And Pilate asked him, \x + \xo 23:3 \xt ver. 37, 38; Matt. 2:2; John 18:39; 19:3 \x*“Are you the King of the Jews?” And he answered him, \x + \xo 23:3 \xt See ch. 22:70\x*\wj “You have said so.”\wj*
\v 4 Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, \x + \xo 23:4 \xt ver. 14, 22; John 18:38; 19:4, 6; [Matt. 27:24; 1 Pet. 2:22]\x*“I find no guilt in this man.”
\v 5 But they were urgent, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, \x + \xo 23:5 \xt ch. 4:14; Matt. 4:12, 23; Mark 1:14; John 1:43; 2:11\x*from Galilee even to this place.”
\s1 Jesus Before Herod
\p
\v 6 When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
\v 7 And when he learned that he belonged to \x + \xo 23:7 \xt See ch. 3:1\x*Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who was himself in Jerusalem at that time.
\v 8 When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, \x + \xo 23:8 \xt ch. 9:9 \x*for he had long desired to see him, \x + \xo 23:8 \xt Matt. 14:1; Mark 6:14 \x*because he had heard about him, and he was hoping \x + \xo 23:8 \xt See Matt. 12:38\x*to see some sign done by him.
\v 9 So he questioned him at some length, but he made no answer.
\v 10 The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him.
\v 11 And Herod with his soldiers \x + \xo 23:11 \xt Mark 9:12; Acts 4:11 \x*treated him with contempt and \x + \xo 23:11 \xt ch. 18:32 \x*mocked him. Then, \x + \xo 23:11 \xt [Matt. 27:28; Mark 15:17]\x*arraying him in splendid clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.
\v 12 And \x + \xo 23:12 \xt Acts 4:27; [Ps. 2:2]\x*Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before this they had been at enmity with each other.
\p
\v 13 Pilate then called together the chief priests and \x + \xo 23:13 \xt See ch. 24:20\x*the rulers and the people,
\v 14 and said to them, “You brought me this man \x + \xo 23:14 \xt ver. 2 \x*as one who was misleading the people. And \x + \xo 23:14 \xt Acts 3:13 \x*after examining him before you, behold, I \x + \xo 23:14 \xt ver. 4\x*did not find this man guilty of any of your charges against him.
\v 15 Neither did Herod, for \x + \xo 23:15 \xt ver. 11\x*he sent him back to us. Look, nothing deserving death has been done by him.
\v 16 \x + \xo 23:16 \xt ver. 22; John 19:1; [Acts 5:40]\x*I will therefore punish and release him.”\f + \fr 23:16 \ft Here, or after verse 19, some manuscripts add verse 17: \fq Now he was obliged to release one man to them at the festival\f*
\s1 Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 23:18 \xt For ver. 18-25, see Matt. 27:15-26; Mark 15:6-15; John 18:39, 40; 19:16 \x*But they all cried out together, \x + \xo 23:18 \xt [Acts 21:36; 22:22]\x*“Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas”—
\v 19 a man who had been thrown into prison for an insurrection started in the city and \x + \xo 23:19 \xt Acts 3:14\x*for murder.
\v 20 Pilate addressed them once more, desiring to release Jesus,
\v 21 but they kept shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!”
\v 22 A third time he said to them, “Why, \x + \xo 23:22 \xt [ver. 41; John 8:46] \x*what evil has he done? \x + \xo 23:22 \xt ver. 14, 15 \x*I have found in him no guilt deserving death. \x + \xo 23:22 \xt ver. 16\x*I will therefore punish and release him.”
\v 23 But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he should be crucified. And their voices prevailed.
\v 24 So Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.
\v 25 He released the man who had been thrown into prison \x + \xo 23:25 \xt ver. 19 \x*for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, \x + \xo 23:25 \xt John 19:16\x*but he delivered Jesus over to their will.
\s1 The Crucifixion
\p
\v 26 \x + \xo 23:26 \xt Matt. 27:32; Mark 15:21; [John 19:17]\x*And as they led him away, they seized one Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it behind Jesus.
\v 27 And there followed him a great multitude of the people and of women who were \x + \xo 23:27 \xt ch. 8:52; Matt. 11:17\x*mourning and lamenting for him.
\v 28 But turning to them Jesus said, \wj “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.\wj*
\v 29 \wj For behold, \wj*\x + \xo 23:29 \xt See ch. 17:22 \x*\wj the days are coming when they will say, \wj*\x + \xo 23:29 \xt ch. 21:23; Matt. 24:19; Mark 13:17\x*\wj ‘Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!’\wj*
\v 30 \x + \xo 23:30 \xt Hos. 10:8; Rev. 6:16; [Isa. 2:19]\x*\wj Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’\wj*
\v 31 \wj For \wj*\x + \xo 23:31 \xt [Prov. 11:31; 1 Pet. 4:17] \x*\wj if they do these things when \wj*\x + \xo 23:31 \xt Ezek. 20:47\x*\wj the wood is green, what will happen \wj*\x + \xo 23:31 \xt Ezek. 20:47\x*\wj when it is dry?”\wj*
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 23:32 \xt Matt. 27:38; Mark 15:27; John 19:18; [Matt. 20:21]\x*Two others, who were criminals, were led away to be put to death with him.
\v 33 \x + \xo 23:33 \xt Matt. 27:33; Mark 15:22; John 19:17 \x*And when they came to the place that is called The Skull, there they crucified him, and the criminals, \x + \xo 23:33 \xt [See ver. 32 above]\x*one on his right and one on his left.
\v 34 And Jesus said, \wj “Father, \wj*\x + \xo 23:34 \xt Isa. 53:12; See Matt. 5:44 \x*\wj forgive them, \wj*\x + \xo 23:34 \xt [Mark 10:38]; See Acts 3:17 \x*\wj for they know not what they do.”\wj*\f + \fr 23:34 \ft Some manuscripts omit the sentence \fq And Jesus~.~.~. what they do\f* And they cast lots \x + \xo 23:34 \xt Ps. 22:18; Matt. 27:35; Mark 15:24; John 19:23\x*to divide his garments.
\v 35 And \x + \xo 23:35 \xt Ps. 22:7, 17 \x*the people stood by, watching, \x + \xo 23:35 \xt Matt. 27:41, 42; Mark 15:31, 32 \x*but \x + \xo 23:35 \xt See ch. 24:20 \x*the rulers \x + \xo 23:35 \xt ch. 16:14 \x*scoffed at him, saying, \x + \xo 23:35 \xt [ch. 4:23] \x*“He saved others; \x + \xo 23:35 \xt [Matt. 26:53, 54; John 10:18] \x*let him save himself, \x + \xo 23:35 \xt [ch. 4:3, 9] \x*if he is \x + \xo 23:35 \xt See ch. 9:20; Matt. 1:17 \x*the Christ of God, \x + \xo 23:35 \xt ch. 9:35; Isa. 42:1; [Matt. 12:18; 1 Pet. 2:4]\x*his Chosen One!”
\v 36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and \x + \xo 23:36 \xt [Ps. 69:21; Matt. 27:48; Mark 15:36; John 19:29]\x*offering him sour wine
\v 37 and saying, \x + \xo 23:37 \xt ver. 35 \x*“If you are \x + \xo 23:37 \xt See ver. 3\x*the King of the Jews, save yourself!”
\v 38 \x + \xo 23:38 \xt Matt. 27:37; Mark 15:26; John 19:19; [John 19:21, 22] \x*There was also an inscription over him,\f + \fr 23:38 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew\f* “This is \x + \xo 23:38 \xt [See ver. 37 above]\x*the King of the Jews.”
\p
\v 39 \x + \xo 23:39 \xt [Matt. 27:44; Mark 15:32] \x*One of the criminals who were hanged \x + \xo 23:39 \xt See Matt. 27:39 \x*railed at him,\f + \fr 23:39 \ft Or \fq blasphemed him\f* saying, “Are you not \x + \xo 23:39 \xt ver. 35, 37\x*the Christ? Save yourself and us!”
\v 40 But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?
\v 41 And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing wrong.”
\v 42 And he said, “Jesus, remember me \x + \xo 23:42 \xt [Matt. 16:28]\x*when you come into your kingdom.”
\v 43 And he said to him, \wj “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in \wj*\x + \xo 23:43 \xt 2 Cor. 12:3; Rev. 2:7\x*\wj Paradise.”\wj*
\s1 The Death of Jesus
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 23:44 \xt Matt. 27:45; Mark 15:33; [John 19:14]\x*It was now about the sixth hour,\f + \fr 23:44 \ft That is, noon\f* and there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour,\f + \fr 23:44 \ft That is, 3 \sc p.m.\sc*\f*
\v 45 while the sun’s light failed. And \x + \xo 23:45 \xt Ex. 26:31-33; 2 Chr. 3:14\x*the curtain of the temple was torn in two.
\v 46 Then Jesus, \x + \xo 23:46 \xt [Matt. 27:50; Mark 15:37; John 19:30] \x*calling out with a loud voice, said, \wj “Father, \wj*\x + \xo 23:46 \xt Cited from Ps. 31:5; [Acts 7:59] \x*\wj into your hands I \wj*\x + \xo 23:46 \xt 1 Pet. 4:19 \x*\wj commit my spirit!”\wj* And having said this \x + \xo 23:46 \xt [John 10:18]\x*he breathed his last.
\v 47 Now \x + \xo 23:47 \xt Matt. 27:54; Mark 15:39 \x*when the centurion saw what had taken place, \x + \xo 23:47 \xt See ch. 7:16\x*he praised God, saying, “Certainly this man was innocent!”
\v 48 And all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, returned home \x + \xo 23:48 \xt ch. 18:13\x*beating their breasts.
\v 49 And all \x + \xo 23:49 \xt Ps. 88:8 \x*his acquaintances and \x + \xo 23:49 \xt ver. 55; John 19:25; See ch. 8:2 \x*the women who had followed him from Galilee \x + \xo 23:49 \xt Ps. 38:11\x*stood at a distance watching these things.
\s1 Jesus Is Buried
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 23:50 \xt For ver. 50-56, see Matt. 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; John 19:38-42\x*Now there was a man named Joseph, from the Jewish town of Arimathea. He was a member of the council, a good and righteous man,
\v 51 who had not consented to their decision and action; and he \x + \xo 23:51 \xt ch. 2:25, 38\x*was looking for the kingdom of God.
\v 52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
\v 53 Then he took it down and wrapped it in a linen shroud and \x + \xo 23:53 \xt [Isa. 53:9] \x*laid him in a tomb cut in stone, \x + \xo 23:53 \xt [Mark 11:2]\x*where no one had ever yet been laid.

\v 56 Then they returned and \x + \xo 23:56 \xt ch. 24:1; Mark 16:1; [John 19:39] \x*prepared spices and ointments.
\p On the Sabbath they rested \x + \xo 23:56 \xt Ex. 20:10; Deut. 5:14\x*according to the commandment.

\s1 The Resurrection
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 24:1 \xt For ver. 1-10, see Matt. 28:1-8; Mark 16:1-8; John 20:1 \x*But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, \x + \xo 24:1 \xt ch. 23:56\x*taking the spices they had prepared.
\v 2 And they found \x + \xo 24:2 \xt Matt. 27:60; Mark 15:46; [John 11]\x*the stone rolled away from the tomb,
\v 3 but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
\v 4 While they were perplexed about this, behold, \x + \xo 24:4 \xt John 20:12 \x*two \x + \xo 24:4 \xt [Acts 1:10; 10:30]\x*men stood by them in dazzling apparel.
\v 5 And as they were \x + \xo 24:5 \xt ver. 37\x*frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, “Why do you seek the living among the dead?
\v 6 He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, \x + \xo 24:6 \xt ch. 9:22, 44; Matt. 17:22, 23; Mark 9:30, 31; [ver. 44]\x*while he was still in Galilee,

\v 8 And \x + \xo 24:8 \xt John 2:22; 12:1\x*they remembered his words,
\v 9 and returning from the tomb they \x + \xo 24:9 \xt [John 20:18]\x*told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.
\v 10 Now it was \x + \xo 24:10 \xt Matt. 27:56; Mark 15:40, 41 \x*Mary Magdalene and \x + \xo 24:10 \xt ch. 8:3\x*Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles,
\v 11 but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and \x + \xo 24:11 \xt Mark 16:11; See Mark 16:16\x*they did not believe them.
\v 12 But \x + \xo 24:12 \xt John 20:3-6 \x*Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw \x + \xo 24:12 \xt John 19:40\x*the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.
\s1 On the Road to Emmaus
\p
\v 13 That very day \x + \xo 24:13 \xt Mark 16:12\x*two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles\f + \fr 24:13 \ft Greek \fq sixty \+tl stadia\+tl*; a \+tl stadion\+tl* was about 607 feet or 185 meters\f* from Jerusalem,
\v 14 and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened.
\v 15 While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them.
\v 16 \x + \xo 24:16 \xt John 20:14; 21:4; [ver. 31; ch. 9:45; 18:34]\x*But their eyes were kept from recognizing him.
\v 17 And he said to them, \wj “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?”\wj* And they stood still, looking sad.
\v 18 Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?”
\v 19 And he said to them, \wj “What things?”\wj* And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was \x + \xo 24:19 \xt See Matt. 21:11 \x*a prophet \x + \xo 24:19 \xt Acts 2:22; [Acts 7:22]\x*mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,

\v 21 But we had hoped that he was \x + \xo 24:21 \xt See ch. 1:68; 1 Pet. 1:18 \x*the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now \x + \xo 24:21 \xt ver. 7\x*the third day since these things happened.
\v 22 Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. \x + \xo 24:22 \xt ver. 1\x*They were at the tomb early in the morning,
\v 23 and \x + \xo 24:23 \xt ver. 3 \x*when they did not find his body, they came back saying that \x + \xo 24:23 \xt ver. 4, 5, 9\x*they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
\v 24 \x + \xo 24:24 \xt ver. 12; John 20:3\x*Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.”
\v 25 And he said to them, \wj “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 24:26 \xt ver. 7, 44, 46; Heb. 2:10; 12:2; 1 Pet. 1:11; See Acts 3:18 \x*\wj Was it not necessary that \wj*\x + \xo 24:26 \xt See Matt. 1:17 \x*\wj the Christ should suffer these things and enter into \wj*\x + \xo 24:26 \xt See ch. 9:26\x*\wj his glory?”\wj*
\v 27 And \x + \xo 24:27 \xt Acts 8:35 \x*beginning with \x + \xo 24:27 \xt Gen. 3:15; 12:3; 22:18; Num. 21:9; 24:17; [John 1:45; 5:46] \x*Moses and \x + \xo 24:27 \xt 2 Sam. 7:12-16; Isa. 7:14; 9:6; 50:6; 52:13–53:12; 61:1; Jer. 23:5, 6; Dan. 7:13, 14; 9:24-27; Mic. 5:2; Zech. 6:12; 9:9; 12:10; 13:7; [Acts 13:27]\x*all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
\p
\v 28 So they drew near to the village to which they were going. \x + \xo 24:28 \xt [Mark 6:48]\x*He acted as if he were going farther,
\v 29 but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and \x + \xo 24:29 \xt ch. 9:12 (Gk.)\x*the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them.
\v 30 When he was at table with them, he took the bread and \x + \xo 24:30 \xt See Matt. 14:19\x*blessed and broke it and gave it to them.
\v 31 \x + \xo 24:31 \xt [ver. 16] \x*And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And \x + \xo 24:31 \xt [ch. 4:30]\x*he vanished from their sight.
\v 32 They said to each other, \x + \xo 24:32 \xt Ps. 39:3 \x*“Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he \x + \xo 24:32 \xt ver. 45\x*opened to us the Scriptures?”
\v 33 And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they \x + \xo 24:33 \xt Mark 16:13; Acts 17:3 \x*found the eleven and \x + \xo 24:33 \xt [Acts 1:14]\x*those who were with them gathered together,
\v 34 saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and \x + \xo 24:34 \xt 1 Cor. 15:5\x*has appeared to Simon!”
\v 35 Then they told what had happened on the road, and \x + \xo 24:35 \xt ver. 30, 31 \x*how he was known to them in \x + \xo 24:35 \xt See Acts 2:42\x*the breaking of the bread.
\s1 Jesus Appears to His Disciples
\p
\v 36 As they were talking about these things, \x + \xo 24:36 \xt Mark 16:14; John 20:19\x*Jesus himself stood among them, and said to them, \wj “Peace to you!”\wj*
\v 37 But they were \x + \xo 24:37 \xt ch. 21:9 \x*startled and \x + \xo 24:37 \xt ver. 5 \x*frightened and \x + \xo 24:37 \xt [Matt. 14:26; Mark 6:49]\x*thought they saw a spirit.
\v 38 And he said to them, \wj “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts arise in your hearts?\wj*
\v 39 \wj See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself. \wj*\x + \xo 24:39 \xt 1 John 1:1; [John 20:27]\x*\wj Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have.”\wj*
\v 40 And when he had said this, \x + \xo 24:40 \xt John 20:20\x*he showed them his hands and his feet.
\v 41 And while they still disbelieved \x + \xo 24:41 \xt Acts 12:14; [Gen. 45:26] \x*for joy and were marveling, \x + \xo 24:41 \xt John 21:5\x*he said to them, \wj “Have you anything here to eat?”\wj*
\v 42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,\f + \fr 24:42 \ft Some manuscripts add \fq and some honeycomb\f*
\v 43 and he took it and ate before them.
\p
\v 44 Then he said to them, \x + \xo 24:44 \xt See ver. 6 \x*\wj “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, \wj*\x + \xo 24:44 \xt See ver. 27\x*\wj that everything written about me in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled.”\wj*
\v 45 Then \x + \xo 24:45 \xt ver. 32; [Job 33:16; Ps. 119:18; Acts 16:14; 1 John 5:20]\x*he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures,
\v 46 and said to them, \wj “Thus \wj*\x + \xo 24:46 \xt See Matt. 26:24 \x*\wj it is written, \wj*\x + \xo 24:46 \xt See ver. 7, 26 \x*\wj that the Christ should suffer and on the third day \wj*\x + \xo 24:46 \xt John 20:9\x*\wj rise from the dead,\wj*
\v 47 \wj and that \wj*\x + \xo 24:47 \xt Acts 5:31; See Acts 2:38 \x*\wj repentance and\wj*\f + \fr 24:47 \ft Some manuscripts \fq for\f*\wj forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed \wj*\x + \xo 24:47 \xt See Acts 4:12 \x*\wj in his name \wj*\x + \xo 24:47 \xt ch. 2:32; Gen. 12:3; Ps. 22:27; Isa. 2:2; 49:6; Hos. 2:23; Mal. 1:11; Matt. 28:19 \x*\wj to all nations, \wj*\x + \xo 24:47 \xt Acts 10:37; Gal. 3:8\x*\wj beginning from Jerusalem.\wj*
\v 48 \x + \xo 24:48 \xt Acts 1:8, 22; 2:32; 3:15; 5:32; 10:39, 41; 13:31; 1 Pet. 5:1; [John 15:27; 1 Cor. 15:15]\x*\wj You are witnesses of these things.\wj*
\v 49 \wj And behold, I am sending \wj*\x + \xo 24:49 \xt John 14:26; Acts 1:4; [Acts 2:33; Eph. 1:13]; See Acts 2:16, 17 \x*\wj the promise of my Father upon you.

\s1 The Ascension
\p
\v 50 Then \x + \xo 24:50 \xt Acts 1:12 \x*he led them out as far as \x + \xo 24:50 \xt Matt. 21:17; John 11:18\x*Bethany, and lifting up his hands he blessed them.
\v 51 While he blessed them, \x + \xo 24:51 \xt See Mark 16:19\x*he parted from them and was carried up into heaven.
\v 52 And they \x + \xo 24:52 \xt Matt. 28:9 \x*worshiped him and \x + \xo 24:52 \xt [See ver. 50 above] \x*returned to Jerusalem \x + \xo 24:52 \xt See John 16:22\x*with great joy,
\v 53 and \x + \xo 24:53 \xt Acts 2:46; 3:1; 5:21, 42 \x*were continually in the temple \x + \xo 24:53 \xt ch. 1:64; 2:28\x*blessing God.
