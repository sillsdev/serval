\s1 Greeting
\p
\v 1 Simeon\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Some manuscripts \fq Simon\f* Peter, a servant\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Or \fq slave \ft (for the contextual rendering of the Greek word \+tl doulos\+tl*, see Preface)\f* and apostle of Jesus Christ,
\p To those who have obtained \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Rom. 1:12; 2 Cor. 4:13; Titus 1:4 \x*a faith of equal standing with ours \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Rom. 3:21-26 \x*by the righteousness of our \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Titus 2:13\x*God and Savior Jesus Christ:
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt 1 Pet. 1:2; Jude 2 \x*May grace and peace be multiplied to you \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ver. 3, 8; ch. 2:20; [John 17:3; Phil. 3:8]\x*in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
\s1 Confirm Your Calling and Election
\p
\v 3 His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him \x + \xo 1:3 \xt [1 Thess. 2:12; 2 Thess. 2:14; 2 Tim. 1:9; 1 Pet. 5:10]\x*who called us to\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or \fq by\f* his own glory and excellence,\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Or \fq virtue\f*
\v 4 by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become \x + \xo 1:4 \xt [Eph. 4:24; Heb. 12:10; 1 John 3:2] \x*partakers of the divine nature, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt ch. 2:18, 20\x*having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
\v 5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Phil. 4:8 \x*with virtue,\f + \fr 1:5 \ft Or \fq excellence\ft ; twice in this verse\f* and virtue \x + \xo 1:5 \xt 1 Pet. 3:7\x*with knowledge,
\v 6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Heb. 10:36; James 1:3\x*with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness,
\v 7 and godliness \x + \xo 1:7 \xt See Heb. 13:1 \x*with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection \x + \xo 1:7 \xt 1 Cor. 13; 1 John 4:16\x*with love.
\v 8 For if these qualities\f + \fr 1:8 \ft Greek \fq these things\ft ; also verses 9, 10, 12\f* are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or \x + \xo 1:8 \xt See John 15:2; Titus 3:14\x*unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 9 For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Job 5:14; 12:25; Isa. 59:10; Zeph. 1:17; [1 John 2:9-11] \x*is blind, having forgotten that he was \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Eph. 5:26; Titus 2:14; Heb. 9:14; 1 John 1:7; Rev. 7:14\x*cleansed from his former sins.
\v 10 Therefore, brothers,\f + \fr 1:10 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church\f* be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and \x + \xo 1:10 \xt 1 Thess. 1:4 \x*election, for if you practice these qualities \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [ch. 3:17; 1 John 2:10]\x*you will never fall.
\v 11 For in this way there will be richly provided for you \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Col. 1:13; [Acts 14:22]\x*an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 12 Therefore I intend \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Jude 5; [Rom. 15:14, 15; Phil. 3:1; 1 John 2:21] \x*always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in \x + \xo 1:12 \xt 2 John 2\x*the truth that you have.
\v 13 I think it right, as long as I am in this \x + \xo 1:13 \xt 2 Cor. 5:1, 4 \x*body,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft Greek \fq tent\ft ; also verse 14\f* \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 3:1\x*to stir you up by way of reminder,
\v 14 \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [Deut. 4:21, 22; 31:14; 2 Tim. 4:6] \x*since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, \x + \xo 1:14 \xt John 21:18, 19\x*as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
\v 15 And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.
\s1 Christ’s Glory and the Prophetic Word
\p
\v 16 For we did not follow \x + \xo 1:16 \xt See 1 Cor. 1:17 \x*cleverly devised \x + \xo 1:16 \xt See 1 Tim. 1:4 \x*myths when we made known to you \x + \xo 1:16 \xt 1 Cor. 2:4 \x*the power and \x + \xo 1:16 \xt See 1 Thess. 2:19 \x*coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Matt. 17:1, 2, 6; Mark 9:2; Luke 9:28, 29; John 1:14\x*we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
\v 17 For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Matt. 17:5; Mark 9:7; Luke 9:35; [Matt. 3:17]\x*“This is my beloved Son,\f + \fr 1:17 \ft Or \fq my Son, my \ft (or \fq the\ft ) \fq Beloved\f* with whom I am well pleased,”
\v 18 we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on \x + \xo 1:18 \xt [Ex. 3:5; Josh. 5:15]\x*the holy mountain.
\v 19 And \x + \xo 1:19 \xt See 1 Pet. 1:10 \x*we have the prophetic word more fully confirmed, to which you will do well to pay attention \x + \xo 1:19 \xt Ps. 119:105; John 5:35 \x*as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until \x + \xo 1:19 \xt Rev. 2:28; 22:16; [Mal. 4:2] \x*the day \x + \xo 1:19 \xt 2 Cor. 4:6\x*dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,
\v 20 knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation.
\v 21 For \x + \xo 1:21 \xt 2 Tim. 3:16 \x*no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God \x + \xo 1:21 \xt 1 Pet. 1:11; [2 Sam. 23:2; Luke 1:70; Acts 1:16; 3:18]\x*as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
\c 2
\s1 False Prophets and Teachers
\p \v 1 But \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Deut. 13:1; See Matt. 7:15 \x*false prophets also arose among the people, \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Acts 20:30; 2 Cor. 11:13; 1 Tim. 4:1; [Matt. 24:11] \x*just as there will be false teachers among you, who will \x + \xo 2:1 \xt Jude 4; [Matt. 10:33; Gal. 2:4] \x*secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master \x + \xo 2:1 \xt 1 Cor. 6:20; 7:23; Gal. 3:13; 4:5; Rev. 5:9; [Ex. 15:16; 1 Pet. 1:18; Rev. 14:3, 4]\x*who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
\v 2 And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Rom. 2:24\x*will be blasphemed.
\v 3 And \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [2 Cor. 12:17, 18; 1 Tim. 6:5; Titus 1:11] \x*in their greed they will exploit you \x + \xo 2:3 \xt Rom. 16:18; Col. 2:4 \x*with false words. \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [Deut. 32:35; Phil. 3:19]\x*Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
\p
\v 4 For if God did not spare \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Jude 6 \x*angels when they sinned, but \x + \xo 2:4 \xt [Rev. 20:2, 3, 10] \x*cast them into hell\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Greek \fq Tartarus\f* and committed them to chains\f + \fr 2:4 \ft Some manuscripts \fq pits\f* of gloomy darkness \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Matt. 25:41\x*to be kept until the judgment;
\v 5 if he did not spare the ancient world, but \x + \xo 2:5 \xt See 1 Pet. 3:20 \x*preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought \x + \xo 2:5 \xt ch. 3:6; Job 22:16\x*a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
\v 6 if by \x + \xo 2:6 \xt See Gen. 19:24 \x*turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [Num. 26:10] \x*making them an example of \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Jude 15\x*what is going to happen to the ungodly;\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Some manuscripts \fq an example to those who were to be ungodly\f*
\v 7 and \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Gen. 19:16\x*if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked
\v 8 (for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, \x + \xo 2:8 \xt Ps. 119:136, 158; [Ezek. 9:4]\x*he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard);
\v 9 then \x + \xo 2:9 \xt 1 Cor. 10:13; Rev. 3:10\x*the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials,\f + \fr 2:9 \ft Or \fq temptations\f* and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,
\v 10 and especially \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Jude 16, 18 \x*those who indulge\f + \fr 2:10 \ft Greek \fq who go after the flesh\f* in the lust of defiling passion and \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Jude 8; [Ex. 22:28]\x*despise authority.
\p Bold and willful, they do not tremble \x + \xo 2:10 \xt Jude 8; [Ex. 22:28]\x*as they blaspheme the glorious ones,
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11 \xt Jude 9\x*whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord.
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Jude 10 \x*But these, like irrational animals, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt [Jer. 12:3; Phil. 3:19]\x*creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction,
\v 13 suffering wrong as \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ver. 15 \x*the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Rom. 13:13; 1 Thess. 5:7]; See James 5:5 \x*to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions,\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Some manuscripts \fq love feasts\f* while \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [1 Cor. 11:21]\x*they feast with you.
\v 14 They have eyes full of adultery, \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [1 Pet. 4:1] \x*insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts \x + \xo 2:14 \xt ver. 3; [1 Tim. 4:7] \x*trained in greed. \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Eph. 2:3]\x*Accursed children!
\v 15 Forsaking the right way, \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Ezek. 14:11 \x*they have gone astray. They have followed \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Num. 22:5, 7; Deut. 23:4; Neh. 13:2; Jude 11; Rev. 2:14 \x*the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ver. 13\x*gain from wrongdoing,
\v 16 but was rebuked for his own transgression; \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Num. 22:21, 23, 28\x*a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Jude 12 \x*These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm. \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Jude 13\x*For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved.
\v 18 For, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Jude 16 \x*speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ver. 20; ch. 1:4\x*escaping from those who live in error.
\v 19 They promise them \x + \xo 2:19 \xt Gal. 5:13; See James 1:25 \x*freedom, \x + \xo 2:19 \xt John 8:34; Rom. 6:16\x*but they themselves are slaves\f + \fr 2:19 \ft Greek \fq bondservants\f* of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.
\v 20 For if, \x + \xo 2:20 \xt ver. 18 \x*after they have escaped the defilements of the world \x + \xo 2:20 \xt See ch. 1:2 \x*through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, \x + \xo 2:20 \xt Matt. 12:45\x*the last state has become worse for them than the first.
\v 21 For \x + \xo 2:21 \xt [Ezek. 18:24; Luke 12:47; Heb. 6:4-6; 10:26, 27; James 4:17] \x*it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from \x + \xo 2:21 \xt Rom. 7:12\x*the holy commandment delivered to them.
\v 22 What the true proverb says has happened to them: “The \x + \xo 2:22 \xt Prov. 26:11\x*dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire.”

\s1 The Day of the Lord Will Come
\p \v 1 This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ch. 1:13\x*I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,
\v 2 \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Jude 17 \x*that you should remember the predictions of \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Luke 1:70; Acts 3:21\x*the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles,
\v 3 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come \x + \xo 3:3 \xt Jude 18 \x*in the last days with scoffing, \x + \xo 3:3 \xt ch. 2:10\x*following their own sinful desires.
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4 \xt Isa. 5:19; Jer. 17:15; Ezek. 11:3; 12:22, 27; Mal. 2:17 \x*They will say, “Where is the promise of \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See 1 Thess. 2:19\x*his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation.”
\v 5 For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Ps. 24:2; 136:6 \x*was formed out of water and through water \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Gen. 1:6, 9; Ps. 33:6; [Heb. 11:3]\x*by the word of God,
\v 6 and that by means of these the world that then existed \x + \xo 3:6 \xt ch. 2:5 \x*was deluged with water and \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Gen. 7:11, 21\x*perished.
\v 7 But by the same word \x + \xo 3:7 \xt ver. 10, 12 \x*the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and \x + \xo 3:7 \xt [2 Thess. 1:9]\x*destruction of the ungodly.
\p
\v 8 But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and \x + \xo 3:8 \xt Ps. 90:4\x*a thousand years as one day.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Hab. 2:3; Heb. 10:37 \x*The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [Eccles. 8:11; Rev. 2:21] \x*as some count slowness, but \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Isa. 30:18; Luke 18:7 \x*is patient toward you,\f + \fr 3:9 \ft Some manuscripts \fq on your account\f* \x + \xo 3:9 \xt Ezek. 18:23, 32; 33:11 \x*not wishing that any should perish, but \x + \xo 3:9 \xt 1 Tim. 2:4\x*that all should reach repentance.
\v 10 But \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See Matt. 24:43 \x*the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then \x + \xo 3:10 \xt [Rev. 6:14; 20:11; 21:1]; See Matt. 24:35 \x*the heavens will pass away with a roar, and \x + \xo 3:10 \xt Isa. 34:4; [Isa. 24:19; Mic. 1:4; Nah. 1:5]\x*the heavenly bodies\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Or \fq elements\ft ; also verse 12\f* will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Greek \fq found\ft ; some manuscripts \fq will be burned up\f*
\p
\v 11 Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, \x + \xo 3:11 \xt 1 Pet. 1:15\x*what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12 \xt [Luke 12:36; 1 Cor. 1:7; 1 Thess. 1:10; Titus 2:13; Jude 21] \x*waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and \x + \xo 3:12 \xt See ver. 10\x*the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn!
\v 13 But according to his promise we are waiting for \x + \xo 3:13 \xt Isa. 65:17; 66:22; Rev. 21:1 \x*new heavens and a new earth \x + \xo 3:13 \xt Isa. 60:21; Rev. 21:27\x*in which righteousness dwells.
\s1 Final Words
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14 \xt 1 Cor. 15:58 \x*Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him \x + \xo 3:14 \xt James 1:27 \x*without spot or \x + \xo 3:14 \xt Phil. 2:15; [Phil. 1:10; 1 Thess. 3:13] \x*blemish, and \x + \xo 3:14 \xt [1 Thess. 5:23]\x*at peace.
\v 15 And count \x + \xo 3:15 \xt See ver. 9 \x*the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as \x + \xo 3:15 \xt [Acts 15:25] \x*our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you \x + \xo 3:15 \xt 1 Cor. 3:10\x*according to the wisdom given him,
\v 16 as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. \x + \xo 3:16 \xt [Heb. 5:11] \x*There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, \x + \xo 3:16 \xt [Isa. 28:13]\x*as they do the other Scriptures.
\v 17 You therefore, beloved, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt ch. 1:12; [Mark 13:23] \x*knowing this beforehand, \x + \xo 3:17 \xt ch. 1:10; 1 Cor. 10:12\x*take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.
\v 18 But \x + \xo 3:18 \xt ch. 1:5; Eph. 4:15; Col. 1:10; 2:19; 1 Pet. 2:2 \x*grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. \x + \xo 3:18 \xt See Rom. 11:36 \x*To him be the glory both now and to the day of \x + \xo 3:18 \xt [ver. 8]\x*eternity. Amen.
