\s1 The Throne in Heaven
\p \v 1 After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 1:10; [Ex. 19:19, 20] \x*like a trumpet, said, \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 11:12 \x*\wj “Come up here, and \wj*\x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 1:1, 19; 22:6\x*\wj I will show you what must take place after this.”\wj*
\v 2 At once \x + \xo 4:2 \xt See ch. 1:10 \x*I was in the Spirit, and behold, \x + \xo 4:2 \xt Ps. 11:4; 103:19; Isa. 66:1; Matt. 5:34; 23:22; See 1 Kgs. 22:19\x*a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne.
\v 3 And he who sat there had the appearance of \x + \xo 4:3 \xt ch. 21:11 \x*jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was \x + \xo 4:3 \xt Ezek. 1:28; [ch. 10:1; Gen. 9:13-17]\x*a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.
\v 4 Around the throne were \x + \xo 4:4 \xt ch. 11:16 \x*twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, \x + \xo 4:4 \xt See ch. 3:4 \x*clothed in white garments, with \x + \xo 4:4 \xt ver. 10; See James 1:12\x*golden crowns on their heads.
\v 5 From the throne came \x + \xo 4:5 \xt ch. 8:5; 11:19; 16:18; [Ex. 19:16] \x*flashes of lightning, and rumblings\f + \fr 4:5 \ft Or \fq voices\ft , or \fq sounds\f* and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning \x + \xo 4:5 \xt [Zech. 4:2] \x*seven torches of fire, \x + \xo 4:5 \xt See ch. 1:4\x*which are the seven spirits of God,
\v 6 and before the throne there was \x + \xo 4:6 \xt ch. 15:2; [ch. 21:18, 21; Ps. 77:19] \x*as it were a sea of glass, like crystal.
\p And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are \x + \xo 4:6 \xt Ezek. 1:5 \x*four living creatures, \x + \xo 4:6 \xt Ezek. 10:12\x*full of eyes in front and behind:
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7 \xt [Ezek. 1:10; 10:14]\x*the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight.
\v 8 And the four living creatures, \x + \xo 4:8 \xt Isa. 6:2 \x*each of them with six wings, are \x + \xo 4:8 \xt ver. 6 \x*full of eyes all around and within, and \x + \xo 4:8 \xt ch. 14:11 \x*day and night they never cease to say,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 4:8 \xt Isa. 6:3 \x*“Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
\q2 \x + \xo 4:8 \xt See ch. 1:4\x*who was and is and is to come!”
\b
\m
\v 9 And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, \x + \xo 4:9 \xt ch. 1:18; 5:13; 15:7; Dan. 4:34; 12:7\x*who lives forever and ever,
\v 10 the twenty-four elders \x + \xo 4:10 \xt ch. 5:8, 14; 7:11; 11:16; 19:4 \x*fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast \x + \xo 4:10 \xt ver. 4\x*their crowns before the throne, saying,
\b
\q1
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11 \xt ch. 5:12 \x*“Worthy are you, our Lord and God,
\q2 to receive glory and honor and power,
\q1 for \x + \xo 4:11 \xt ch. 10:6; 14:7; Gen. 1:1; Acts 14:15 \x*you created all things,
\q2 and \x + \xo 4:11 \xt Ps. 33:9-11; [Eph. 1:11]\x*by your will they existed and were created.”
\c 5
\s1 The Scroll and the Lamb
\p \v 1 Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Ezek. 2:9, 10 \x*a scroll written within and on the back, \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Isa. 29:11; Dan. 12:4\x*sealed with seven seals.
\v 2 And \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [ch. 10:1; 18:21]\x*I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?”
\v 3 And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,
\v 4 and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
\v 5 And one of the elders said to me, “Weep no more; behold, \x + \xo 5:5 \xt Gen. 49:9 \x*the Lion \x + \xo 5:5 \xt Heb. 7:14 \x*of the tribe of Judah, \x + \xo 5:5 \xt ch. 22:16; Isa. 11:1, 10; Rom. 15:12\x*the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”
\p
\v 6 And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw \x + \xo 5:6 \xt ver. 9, 12; ch. 13:8; Isa. 53:7; John 1:29, 36; 1 Pet. 1:19 \x*a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with \x + \xo 5:6 \xt Zech. 3:9; 4:10 \x*seven eyes, which are \x + \xo 5:6 \xt See ch. 1:4\x*the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
\v 7 And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
\v 8 And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders \x + \xo 5:8 \xt See ch. 4:10 \x*fell down before the Lamb, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt ch. 14:2; 15:2 \x*each holding a harp, and \x + \xo 5:8 \xt [ch. 15:7] \x*golden bowls full of incense, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt ch. 8:3, 4; Ps. 141:2\x*which are the prayers of the saints.
\v 9 And they sang \x + \xo 5:9 \xt ch. 14:3; See Ps. 33:3 \x*a new song, saying,
\b
\q1 “Worthy are you to take the scroll
\q2 and to open its seals,
\q1 for \x + \xo 5:9 \xt ver. 6 \x*you were slain, and by your blood \x + \xo 5:9 \xt ch. 14:3, 4; See 2 Pet. 2:1 \x*you ransomed people for God
\q2 from \x + \xo 5:9 \xt ch. 7:9; 11:9; 14:6; See Dan. 3:4\x*every tribe and language and people and nation,
\q1
\v 10 and you have made them \x + \xo 5:10 \xt See ch. 1:6\x*a kingdom and priests to our God,
\q2 and they shall reign on the earth.”
\b
\m
\v 11 Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering \x + \xo 5:11 \xt Dan. 7:10; [Heb. 12:22]\x*myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
\v 12 saying with a loud voice,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 5:12 \xt ch. 4:11\x*“Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
\q1 to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might
\q1 and honor and glory and blessing!”
\b
\m
\v 13 And I heard \x + \xo 5:13 \xt Ps. 145:21; 150:6\x*every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying,
\b
\q1 “To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb
\q1 be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!”
\b
\m
\v 14 And the four living creatures \x + \xo 5:14 \xt ch. 7:12; 19:4 \x*said, “Amen!” and the elders \x + \xo 5:14 \xt ver. 8; See ch. 4:10\x*fell down and worshiped.
\c 6
\s1 The Seven Seals
\p
\v 1 Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 5:1, 5-7 \x*the seven seals, and I heard \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 4:7 \x*one of the four living creatures say \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 14:2; 19:6 \x*with a voice like thunder, \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 22:20\x*“Come!”
\v 2 And I looked, and behold, \x + \xo 6:2 \xt Zech. 6:3; [ch. 19:11, 19, 21] \x*a white horse! And \x + \xo 6:2 \xt [Ps. 45:4, 5; Hab. 3:8, 9; Zech. 9:13, 14] \x*its rider had a bow, and \x + \xo 6:2 \xt ch. 14:14; [Zech. 6:11] \x*a crown was given to him, and he came out \x + \xo 6:2 \xt See ch. 3:21\x*conquering, and to conquer.
\p
\v 3 When he opened the second seal, I heard \x + \xo 6:3 \xt ch. 4:7\x*the second living creature say, “Come!”
\v 4 And out came another horse, \x + \xo 6:4 \xt Zech. 1:8; 6:2 \x*bright red. Its rider was permitted \x + \xo 6:4 \xt [Matt. 10:34; 24:6, 7]\x*to take peace from the earth, so that people should slay one another, and he was given a great sword.
\p
\v 5 When he opened the third seal, I heard the \x + \xo 6:5 \xt [See ver. 3 above] \x*third living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and behold, \x + \xo 6:5 \xt Zech. 6:2\x*a black horse! And its rider had a pair of scales in his hand.
\v 6 And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, \x + \xo 6:6 \xt [Ezek. 4:10, 11; 5:10, 16] \x*“A quart\f + \fr 6:6 \ft Greek \+tl choinix\+tl*, a dry measure equal to about a quart\f* of wheat for a denarius,\f + \fr 6:6 \ft A \fq denarius \ft was a day’s wage for a laborer\f* and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and \x + \xo 6:6 \xt ch. 7:3; 9:4\x*do not harm the oil and wine!”
\p
\v 7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of \x + \xo 6:7 \xt [See ver. 3 above]\x*the fourth living creature say, “Come!”
\v 8 And I looked, and behold, \x + \xo 6:8 \xt [Zech. 6:3] \x*a pale horse! And its rider’s name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill \x + \xo 6:8 \xt Ezek. 14:21 \x*with sword and with famine and with pestilence and \x + \xo 6:8 \xt Lev. 26:22; Deut. 32:24\x*by wild beasts of the earth.
\p
\v 9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under \x + \xo 6:9 \xt ch. 14:18; 16:7 \x*the altar \x + \xo 6:9 \xt ch. 20:4 \x*the souls of those who had been slain \x + \xo 6:9 \xt ch. 1:9 \x*for the word of God and for \x + \xo 6:9 \xt See ch. 1:2\x*the witness they had borne.
\v 10 They cried out with a loud voice, “O Sovereign Lord, \x + \xo 6:10 \xt ch. 3:7 \x*holy and true, \x + \xo 6:10 \xt [Ps. 94:3; Zech. 1:12] \x*how long \x + \xo 6:10 \xt ch. 11:18; 19:2 \x*before you will judge and \x + \xo 6:10 \xt Ps. 79:10; 119:84; Luke 18:7, 8 \x*avenge our blood on \x + \xo 6:10 \xt See ch. 3:10\x*those who dwell on the earth?”
\v 11 Then they were each given \x + \xo 6:11 \xt ch. 3:4; 7:9 \x*a white robe and \x + \xo 6:11 \xt ch. 14:13 \x*told to rest a little longer, \x + \xo 6:11 \xt [Heb. 11:40] \x*until the number of their fellow servants\f + \fr 6:11 \ft Greek \fq fellow bondservants\f* and their brothers\f + \fr 6:11 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church\f* \x + \xo 6:11 \xt [Gen. 15:16]\x*should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.
\p
\v 12 When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, \x + \xo 6:12 \xt ch. 11:13; 16:18; [Heb. 12:26] \x*there was a great earthquake, and \x + \xo 6:12 \xt See Matt. 24:29 \x*the sun became black as \x + \xo 6:12 \xt Isa. 50:3\x*sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,
\v 13 and \x + \xo 6:13 \xt [ch. 8:10; 9:1] \x*the stars of the sky fell to the earth \x + \xo 6:13 \xt Isa. 34:4\x*as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14 \xt [ch. 20:11; 21:1] \x*The sky vanished \x + \xo 6:14 \xt [See ver. 13 above] \x*like a scroll that is being rolled up, and \x + \xo 6:14 \xt ch. 16:20; [Isa. 54:10; Jer. 4:24; Ezek. 38:20; Nah. 1:5]\x*every mountain and island was removed from its place.
\v 15 Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave\f + \fr 6:15 \ft Or \fq servant\ft ; Greek \fq bondservant\f* and free, \x + \xo 6:15 \xt Isa. 2:19, 21\x*hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,
\v 16 \x + \xo 6:16 \xt Hos. 10:8; Luke 23:30 \x*calling to the mountains and rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of \x + \xo 6:16 \xt ch. 4:2\x*him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
\v 17 for \x + \xo 6:17 \xt Jer. 30:7; Joel 2:11, 31 \x*the great day of their wrath has come, and \x + \xo 6:17 \xt Ezra 9:15; Ps. 76:7; Mal. 3:2; Luke 21:36\x*who can stand?”
\c 7
\s1 The 144,000 of Israel Sealed
\p \v 1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back \x + \xo 7:1 \xt Jer. 49:36; Dan. 7:2 \x*the four winds of the earth, \x + \xo 7:1 \xt [ver. 3]\x*that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree.
\v 2 Then I saw another angel ascending \x + \xo 7:2 \xt ch. 16:12 \x*from the rising of the sun, with \x + \xo 7:2 \xt ch. 9:4\x*the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea,
\v 3 saying, \x + \xo 7:3 \xt ch. 6:6; 9:4 \x*“Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants\f + \fr 7:3 \ft Greek \fq bondservants\f* of our God \x + \xo 7:3 \xt ch. 14:1; 22:4; Ezek. 9:4; [ch. 13:16; Ezek. 3:8, 9]\x*on their foreheads.”
\v 4 And \x + \xo 7:4 \xt ch. 9:16\x*I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:
\b
\q1
\v 5 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,
\q1
\v 6 12,000 from the tribe of Asher,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,
\q1
\v 7 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Levi,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,
\q1
\v 8 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph,
\q1 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
\s1 A Great Multitude from Every Nation
\p
\v 9 After this I looked, and behold, \x + \xo 7:9 \xt [Rom. 11:25] \x*a great multitude that no one could number, \x + \xo 7:9 \xt ch. 5:9 \x*from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, \x + \xo 7:9 \xt ver. 14; See ch. 3:4 \x*clothed in white robes, with \x + \xo 7:9 \xt [Lev. 23:40; John 12:13]\x*palm branches in their hands,
\v 10 and crying out with a loud voice, \x + \xo 7:10 \xt ch. 12:10; 19:1; See Ps. 3:8\x*“Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!”
\v 11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and \x + \xo 7:11 \xt ch. 4:6 \x*the four living creatures, and they \x + \xo 7:11 \xt See ch. 4:10\x*fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
\v 12 \x + \xo 7:12 \xt ch. 5:14; 19:4; [1 Chr. 29:10, 11]\x*saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”
\p
\v 13 Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, \x + \xo 7:13 \xt [See ver. 9 above]\x*clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?”
\v 14 I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of \x + \xo 7:14 \xt See Matt. 24:21 \x*the great tribulation. \x + \xo 7:14 \xt ch. 22:14; [Isa. 1:18; Zech. 3:3-5] \x*They have washed their robes and \x + \xo 7:14 \xt [Dan. 12:10; 1 John 1:7] \x*made them white \x + \xo 7:14 \xt ch. 1:5\x*in the blood of the Lamb.
\b
\q1
\v 15 “Therefore they are before the throne of God,
\q2 and \x + \xo 7:15 \xt ch. 22:3 \x*serve him day and night in his temple;
\q2 and he who sits on the throne \x + \xo 7:15 \xt ch. 21:3; [Isa. 4:5, 6]\x*will shelter them with his presence.
\q1
\v 16 \x + \xo 7:16 \xt Isa. 49:10 \x*They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore;
\q2 \x + \xo 7:16 \xt Ps. 121:6\x*the sun shall not strike them,
\q2 nor any scorching heat.
\q1
\v 17 For the Lamb in the midst of the throne \x + \xo 7:17 \xt Ps. 23:1, 2; [Matt. 2:6]; See John 10:11 \x*will be their shepherd,
\q2 and he will guide them to springs of \x + \xo 7:17 \xt ch. 22:1; [Ps. 36:8, 9; John 4:14] \x*living water,
\q1 and \x + \xo 7:17 \xt ch. 21:4; Isa. 25:8\x*God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
\c 8
\s1 The Seventh Seal and the Golden Censer
\p \v 1 When the Lamb opened \x + \xo 8:1 \xt ch. 5:1; 6:1\x*the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
\v 2 Then I saw the seven angels \x + \xo 8:2 \xt Luke 1:19\x*who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
\v 3 And another angel came and stood \x + \xo 8:3 \xt Amos 9:1 \x*at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with \x + \xo 8:3 \xt ch. 5:8 \x*the prayers of all the saints on \x + \xo 8:3 \xt ch. 9:13; Ex. 30:1, 3\x*the golden altar before the throne,
\v 4 and \x + \xo 8:4 \xt [Ps. 141:2]\x*the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.
\v 5 Then the angel took the censer and \x + \xo 8:5 \xt Lev. 16:12 \x*filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and \x + \xo 8:5 \xt [Ps. 18:7, 8] \x*there were peals of \x + \xo 8:5 \xt See ch. 4:5\x*thunder, rumblings,\f + \fr 8:5 \ft Or \fq voices\ft , or \fq sounds\f* flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
\s1 The Seven Trumpets
\p
\v 6 Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
\p
\v 7 The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed \x + \xo 8:7 \xt Ex. 9:23, 24; Ps. 18:13; Ezek. 38:22 \x*hail and \x + \xo 8:7 \xt Joel 2:30 \x*fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a \x + \xo 8:7 \xt ver. 8-12; ch. 9:15, 18; 12:4; [Zech. 13:8, 9] \x*third of the earth was burned up, and a third of \x + \xo 8:7 \xt ch. 9:4; Isa. 2:13\x*the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
\p
\v 8 The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like \x + \xo 8:8 \xt Jer. 51:25; [Mark 11:23] \x*a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea \x + \xo 8:8 \xt ch. 11:6; [Ex. 7:17, 19]\x*became blood.
\v 9 A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of \x + \xo 8:9 \xt Isa. 2:16\x*the ships were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and \x + \xo 8:10 \xt ch. 9:1; [Isa. 14:12] \x*a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on \x + \xo 8:10 \xt ch. 14:7; 16:4\x*the springs of water.
\v 11 The name of the star is Wormwood.\f + \fr 8:11 \fq Wormwood \ft is the name of a plant and of the bitter-tasting extract derived from it\f* A third of the waters \x + \xo 8:11 \xt Deut. 29:18; Jer. 9:15; 23:15 \x*became wormwood, and many people died from the water, \x + \xo 8:11 \xt [Ex. 15:23]\x*because it had been made bitter.
\p
\v 12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [Ex. 10:21-23; Isa. 13:10; 30:26]\x*the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night.
\p
\v 13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, \x + \xo 8:13 \xt [ch. 9:12; 11:14]\x*“Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!”
\c 9
\p \v 1 And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and \x + \xo 9:1 \xt ch. 8:10; [ch. 12:9; Luke 10:18] \x*I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given \x + \xo 9:1 \xt See ch. 1:18 \x*the key to the shaft of \x + \xo 9:1 \xt ver. 2, 11; ch. 11:7; 17:8; 20:1, 3; Luke 8:31; Rom. 10:7\x*the bottomless pit.\f + \fr 9:1 \ft Greek \fq the abyss\ft ; also verses 2, 11\f*
\v 2 He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft \x + \xo 9:2 \xt [Gen. 19:28; Isa. 34:10] \x*rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and \x + \xo 9:2 \xt [Joel 2:10]\x*the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
\v 3 Then from the smoke came \x + \xo 9:3 \xt See Ex. 10:4\x*locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth.
\v 4 They were told \x + \xo 9:4 \xt ch. 6:6; 7:3 \x*not to harm \x + \xo 9:4 \xt ch. 8:7 \x*the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have \x + \xo 9:4 \xt See ch. 7:2, 3\x*the seal of God on their foreheads.
\v 5 They were allowed to torment them \x + \xo 9:5 \xt ver. 10\x*for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone.
\v 6 And in those days \x + \xo 9:6 \xt Job 3:21; 7:15, 16; Jer. 8:3\x*people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7 \xt Joel 2:4 \x*In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: \x + \xo 9:7 \xt [Nah. 3:17] \x*on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were \x + \xo 9:7 \xt Dan. 7:8\x*like human faces,
\v 8 their hair like women’s hair, and \x + \xo 9:8 \xt Joel 1:6\x*their teeth like lions’ teeth;
\v 9 they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was \x + \xo 9:9 \xt Joel 2:5 \x*like the noise of many chariots with \x + \xo 9:9 \xt Jer. 8:6; [Job 39:21-25]\x*horses rushing into battle.
\v 10 They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people \x + \xo 9:10 \xt ver. 5\x*for five months is in their tails.
\v 11 They have \x + \xo 9:11 \xt [Job 18:14; Prov. 30:27; Eph. 2:2] \x*as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is \x + \xo 9:11 \xt See Job 26:6\x*Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.\f + \fr 9:11 \fq Abaddon \ft means \fq destruction\ft ; \fq Apollyon \ft means \fq destroyer\f*
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 9:12 \xt [ch. 8:13; 11:14]\x*The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come.
\p
\v 13 Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from \x + \xo 9:13 \xt Ex. 30:3\x*the four horns of the golden altar before God,
\v 14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release \x + \xo 9:14 \xt [ch. 7:1] \x*the four angels who are bound at \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ch. 16:12\x*the great river Euphrates.”
\v 15 So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, were released \x + \xo 9:15 \xt See ch. 8:7\x*to kill a third of mankind.
\v 16 The number of \x + \xo 9:16 \xt Ezek. 38:4 \x*mounted troops was \x + \xo 9:16 \xt [Ps. 68:17; Dan. 7:10] \x*twice ten thousand times ten thousand; \x + \xo 9:16 \xt ch. 7:4\x*I heard their number.
\v 17 And this is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode them: they wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire\f + \fr 9:17 \ft Greek \fq hyacinth\f* and of sulfur, and the heads of the horses were \x + \xo 9:17 \xt [1 Chr. 12:8; Isa. 5:28, 29]\x*like lions’ heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths.
\v 18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths.
\v 19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents with heads, and by means of them they wound.
\p
\v 20 The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, \x + \xo 9:20 \xt See ch. 2:21 \x*did not repent of \x + \xo 9:20 \xt Deut. 31:29; Jer. 1:16; 25:14 \x*the works of their hands nor give up worshiping \x + \xo 9:20 \xt See 1 Cor. 10:20 \x*demons \x + \xo 9:20 \xt Ps. 115:4-7; 135:15-17; Dan. 5:23\x*and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk,
\v 21 nor did they repent of their murders or their \x + \xo 9:21 \xt ch. 21:8; 22:15; Gal. 5:20\x*sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.
\c 10
\s1 The Angel and the Little Scroll
\p \v 1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with \x + \xo 10:1 \xt Ezek. 1:28 \x*a rainbow over his head, and \x + \xo 10:1 \xt ch. 1:16; Matt. 17:2 \x*his face was like the sun, and \x + \xo 10:1 \xt ch. 1:15\x*his legs like pillars of fire.
\v 2 \x + \xo 10:2 \xt ver. 8-10\x*He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land,
\v 3 and called out with a loud voice, \x + \xo 10:3 \xt Joel 3:16; Amos 1:2\x*like a lion roaring. When he called out, the seven thunders sounded.
\v 4 And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, \x + \xo 10:4 \xt Dan. 8:26; 12:4, 9; [ch. 22:10]\x*“Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down.”
\v 5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land \x + \xo 10:5 \xt See Gen. 14:22\x*raised his right hand to heaven
\v 6 and swore by \x + \xo 10:6 \xt See ch. 4:9 \x*him who lives forever and ever, \x + \xo 10:6 \xt See ch. 4:11\x*who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay,
\v 7 but that \x + \xo 10:7 \xt ch. 11:15 \x*in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, \x + \xo 10:7 \xt [Amos 3:7]\x*just as he announced to his servants\f + \fr 10:7 \ft Greek \fq bondservants\f* the prophets.
\p
\v 8 Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, “Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
\v 9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, \x + \xo 10:9 \xt Ezek. 2:8; 3:1-3 \x*“Take and \x + \xo 10:9 \xt [Jer. 15:16]\x*eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.”
\v 10 And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter.
\v 11 And I was told, \x + \xo 10:11 \xt [Ezek. 37:4]\x*“You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.”
\c 11
\s1 The Two Witnesses
\p \v 1 Then I was given \x + \xo 11:1 \xt ch. 21:15, 16; Ezek. 40:3; Zech. 2:1\x*a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, “Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there,
\v 2 but do not measure \x + \xo 11:2 \xt Ezek. 40:17, 20 \x*the court outside the temple; leave that out, for \x + \xo 11:2 \xt See Luke 21:24 \x*it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for \x + \xo 11:2 \xt ch. 12:6; 13:5\x*forty-two months.
\v 3 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for \x + \xo 11:3 \xt [See ver. 2 above] \x*1,260 days, \x + \xo 11:3 \xt Isa. 20:2\x*clothed in sackcloth.”
\p
\v 4 These are \x + \xo 11:4 \xt Zech. 4:3, 11, 14; [Ps. 52:8; Jer. 11:16]\x*the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
\v 5 And if anyone would harm them, \x + \xo 11:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 1:10, 12; Jer. 5:14] \x*fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, \x + \xo 11:5 \xt [Num. 16:29, 35]\x*this is how he is doomed to be killed.
\v 6 They have the power \x + \xo 11:6 \xt [1 Kgs. 17:1; Luke 4:25; James 5:17] \x*to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and \x + \xo 11:6 \xt [Ex. 7–10; 1 Sam. 4:8]\x*to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire.
\v 7 And when they have finished their testimony, \x + \xo 11:7 \xt ch. 17:8; [ch. 13:1] \x*the beast that rises from \x + \xo 11:7 \xt See ch. 9:1 \x*the bottomless pit\f + \fr 11:7 \ft Or \fq the abyss\f* \x + \xo 11:7 \xt Dan. 7:21\x*will make war on them and conquer them and kill them,
\v 8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically\f + \fr 11:8 \ft Greek \fq spiritually\f* is called \x + \xo 11:8 \xt Isa. 1:10; 3:9 \x*Sodom and \x + \xo 11:8 \xt [Ezek. 23:3, 8, 19, 27]\x*Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.
\v 9 For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Ps. 79:2, 3\x*refuse to let them be placed in a tomb,
\v 10 and \x + \xo 11:10 \xt [John 16:20]; See ch. 3:10 \x*those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and \x + \xo 11:10 \xt Neh. 8:10, 12; Esth. 9:19, 22 \x*exchange presents, because these two prophets \x + \xo 11:10 \xt [1 Kgs. 18:17]\x*had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth.
\v 11 But after the three and a half days \x + \xo 11:11 \xt Gen. 2:7; Ezek. 37:5, 9, 10, 14\x*a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them.
\v 12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, \x + \xo 11:12 \xt ch. 4:1 \x*“Come up here!” And \x + \xo 11:12 \xt [ch. 12:5; 2 Kgs. 2:11] \x*they went up to heaven \x + \xo 11:12 \xt [Acts 1:9]\x*in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
\v 13 And at that hour there was \x + \xo 11:13 \xt ch. 6:12 \x*a great earthquake, and \x + \xo 11:13 \xt [ch. 16:19] \x*a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and \x + \xo 11:13 \xt ch. 14:7; 16:9; 19:7; Josh. 7:19 \x*gave glory to \x + \xo 11:13 \xt 2 Chr. 36:23\x*the God of heaven.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 11:14 \xt [ch. 8:13; 9:12]\x*The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.
\s1 The Seventh Trumpet
\p
\v 15 Then \x + \xo 11:15 \xt ch. 10:7 \x*the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and \x + \xo 11:15 \xt ch. 16:17; 19:1; [Isa. 27:13] \x*there were loud voices in heaven, saying, \x + \xo 11:15 \xt ch. 12:10 \x*“The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of \x + \xo 11:15 \xt Ps. 2:2 (Gk.); Luke 9:20 \x*his Christ, and \x + \xo 11:15 \xt See Luke 1:33\x*he shall reign forever and ever.”
\v 16 And the twenty-four elders \x + \xo 11:16 \xt ch. 4:4 \x*who sit on their thrones before God \x + \xo 11:16 \xt See ch. 4:10\x*fell on their faces and worshiped God,
\v 17 saying,
\b
\q1 “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
\q2 \x + \xo 11:17 \xt ch. 16:5; [ch. 1:4, 8; 4:8] \x*who is and who was,
\q1 for you have taken your great power
\q2 and \x + \xo 11:17 \xt ch. 19:6; Ps. 97:1\x*begun to reign.
\q1
\v 18 The nations raged,
\q2 but \x + \xo 11:18 \xt Ps. 2:5; 110:5 \x*your wrath came,
\q2 and \x + \xo 11:18 \xt ch. 6:10; 20:12; [Dan. 7:10; 2 Thess. 1:6, 7] \x*the time for the dead to be judged,
\q1 and for rewarding your servants,\f + \fr 11:18 \ft Greek \fq bondservants\f* the prophets and saints,
\q2 and \x + \xo 11:18 \xt ch. 19:5 \x*those who fear your name,
\q2 both small and great,
\q1 and \x + \xo 11:18 \xt [ch. 13:10]\x*for destroying the destroyers of the earth.”
\b
\p
\v 19 Then \x + \xo 11:19 \xt ch. 15:5 \x*God’s temple in heaven was opened, and \x + \xo 11:19 \xt See Heb. 9:4 \x*the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings,\f + \fr 11:19 \ft Or \fq voices\ft , or \fq sounds\f* peals of thunder, an earthquake, and \x + \xo 11:19 \xt ch. 16:21\x*heavy hail.
\c 12
\s1 The Woman and the Dragon
\p \v 1 And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman \x + \xo 12:1 \xt [Ps. 104:2] \x*clothed with \x + \xo 12:1 \xt [Song 6:10]\x*the sun, with \x + \xo 12:1 \xt [Song 6:10]\x*the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
\v 2 She was pregnant and \x + \xo 12:2 \xt [Isa. 66:7-10; Mic. 4:10]\x*was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.
\v 3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great \x + \xo 12:3 \xt [ch. 17:3; Isa. 27:1] \x*red dragon, \x + \xo 12:3 \xt ch. 13:1; 17:9, 12 \x*with seven heads and \x + \xo 12:3 \xt Dan. 7:7 \x*ten horns, and on his heads \x + \xo 12:3 \xt [ch. 19:12]\x*seven diadems.
\v 4 His tail swept down \x + \xo 12:4 \xt See ch. 8:7 \x*a third of the stars of heaven and \x + \xo 12:4 \xt Dan. 8:10 \x*cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child \x + \xo 12:4 \xt [Matt. 2:16]\x*he might devour it.
\v 5 She gave birth to a male child, \x + \xo 12:5 \xt Matt. 2:6; See ch. 2:27 \x*one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was \x + \xo 12:5 \xt See 2 Cor. 12:2\x*caught up to God and to his throne,
\v 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for \x + \xo 12:6 \xt ch. 11:2; 13:5\x*1,260 days.
\s1 Satan Thrown Down to Earth
\p
\v 7 Now war arose in heaven, \x + \xo 12:7 \xt See Jude 9 \x*Michael and \x + \xo 12:7 \xt See Matt. 25:41\x*his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back,
\v 8 but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
\v 9 And \x + \xo 12:9 \xt Luke 10:18; John 12:31 \x*the great dragon was thrown down, \x + \xo 12:9 \xt ch. 20:2; Gen. 3:1 \x*that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, \x + \xo 12:9 \xt ch. 20:3, 10; [ch. 13:14; John 8:44] \x*the deceiver of the whole world—\x + \xo 12:9 \xt See ch. 9:1\x*he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
\v 10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, “Now \x + \xo 12:10 \xt ch. 7:10; 19:1 \x*the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers\f + \fr 12:10 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* has been thrown down, \x + \xo 12:10 \xt Job 1:9; 2:5; Zech. 3:1\x*who accuses them day and night before our God.
\v 11 And \x + \xo 12:11 \xt ch. 15:2; [Rom. 16:20]; See John 16:33 \x*they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for \x + \xo 12:11 \xt Luke 14:26; John 12:25 \x*they loved not their lives \x + \xo 12:11 \xt ch. 2:10\x*even unto death.
\v 12 Therefore, \x + \xo 12:12 \xt ch. 18:20; Ps. 96:11; Isa. 44:23; 49:13 \x*rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But \x + \xo 12:12 \xt ch. 8:13 \x*woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because \x + \xo 12:12 \xt [Matt. 8:29]; See ch. 10:6\x*he knows that his time is short!”
\p
\v 13 And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued \x + \xo 12:13 \xt ver. 5\x*the woman who had given birth to the male child.
\v 14 But the woman was given the two \x + \xo 12:14 \xt See Ex. 19:4 \x*wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent \x + \xo 12:14 \xt ver. 6 \x*into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished \x + \xo 12:14 \xt Dan. 7:25; 12:7; See ver. 6\x*for a time, and times, and half a time.
\v 15 The serpent poured water \x + \xo 12:15 \xt [Isa. 59:19]\x*like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.
\v 16 But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.
\v 17 Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off \x + \xo 12:17 \xt ch. 11:7; 13:7 \x*to make war on the rest of \x + \xo 12:17 \xt Gen. 3:15 \x*her offspring, \x + \xo 12:17 \xt ch. 14:12; See 1 John 2:3 \x*on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to \x + \xo 12:17 \xt ch. 1:2; 6:9; 19:10\x*the testimony of Jesus. And he stood\f + \fr 12:17 \ft Some manuscripts \fq And I stood\ft , connecting the sentence with 13:1\f* on the sand of the sea.
\c 13
\s1 The First Beast
\p \v 1 And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, \x + \xo 13:1 \xt Dan. 7:3; See ch. 12:3 \x*with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and \x + \xo 13:1 \xt ch. 17:3\x*blasphemous names on its heads.
\v 2 And the beast that I saw was \x + \xo 13:2 \xt Dan. 7:6 \x*like a leopard; its feet were like \x + \xo 13:2 \xt Dan. 7:5 \x*a bear’s, and its mouth was like \x + \xo 13:2 \xt Dan. 7:4 \x*a lion’s mouth. And to it \x + \xo 13:2 \xt ver. 4, 11; [Luke 4:6] \x*the dragon gave his power and \x + \xo 13:2 \xt ch. 16:10\x*his throne and great authority.
\v 3 One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and \x + \xo 13:3 \xt [ch. 17:8]\x*the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
\v 4 And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, \x + \xo 13:4 \xt [ch. 18:18]\x*“Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”

\s1 The Second Beast
\p
\v 11 Then \x + \xo 13:11 \xt [ver. 1, 14; ch. 16:13]\x*I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.

\v 15 And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not \x + \xo 13:15 \xt ch. 14:9, 11; 16:2; 19:20; 20:4 \x*worship the image of the beast \x + \xo 13:15 \xt [ch. 16:6]\x*to be slain.
\v 16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave,\f + \fr 13:16 \ft Greek \fq bondservant\f* \x + \xo 13:16 \xt [ch. 7:3]; See Gal. 6:17\x*to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,

\s1 The Lamb and the 144,000
\p \v 1 Then I looked, and behold, on \x + \xo 14:1 \xt Ps. 2:6; Heb. 12:22 \x*Mount Zion \x + \xo 14:1 \xt See ch. 5:6 \x*stood the Lamb, and with him \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 7:4 \x*144,000 who \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 3:12 \x*had his name and his Father’s name written \x + \xo 14:1 \xt ch. 7:3\x*on their foreheads.
\v 2 And I heard a voice from heaven \x + \xo 14:2 \xt See ch. 1:15 \x*like the roar of many waters and \x + \xo 14:2 \xt ch. 6:1; 19:6 \x*like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of \x + \xo 14:2 \xt ch. 5:8; 15:2\x*harpists playing on their harps,
\v 3 and they were singing \x + \xo 14:3 \xt ch. 5:9 \x*a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. \x + \xo 14:3 \xt [ch. 2:17; 19:12]\x*No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
\v 4 It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for \x + \xo 14:4 \xt 2 Cor. 11:2 \x*they are virgins. It is these \x + \xo 14:4 \xt [ch. 3:4; 17:14] \x*who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as \x + \xo 14:4 \xt James 1:18\x*firstfruits for God and the Lamb,
\v 5 and \x + \xo 14:5 \xt Zeph. 3:13; [Ps. 32:2; Isa. 63:8; John 1:47] \x*in their mouth no lie was found, for they are \x + \xo 14:5 \xt See Jude 24\x*blameless.
\s1 The Messages of the Three Angels
\p
\v 6 Then I saw another angel \x + \xo 14:6 \xt ch. 8:13 \x*flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to \x + \xo 14:6 \xt [ch. 3:10]\x*those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.
\v 7 And he said with a loud voice, \x + \xo 14:7 \xt ch. 15:4 \x*“Fear God and \x + \xo 14:7 \xt See ch. 11:13 \x*give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and \x + \xo 14:7 \xt Neh. 9:6; See ch. 4:11 \x*worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the \x + \xo 14:7 \xt ch. 8:10; 16:4\x*springs of water.”
\p
\v 8 Another angel, a second, followed, saying, \x + \xo 14:8 \xt ch. 18:2; Isa. 21:9; Jer. 51:8 \x*“Fallen, fallen is \x + \xo 14:8 \xt ch. 16:19; 17:5; 18:10; [Dan. 4:30] \x*Babylon the great, \x + \xo 14:8 \xt Jer. 51:7 \x*she who made all nations drink \x + \xo 14:8 \xt ch. 18:3\x*the wine of the passion\f + \fr 14:8 \ft Or \fq wrath\f* of her sexual immorality.”
\p
\v 9 And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone \x + \xo 14:9 \xt See ch. 13:15 \x*worships the beast and its image and receives \x + \xo 14:9 \xt ch. 13:16\x*a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
\v 10 he also will drink \x + \xo 14:10 \xt ch. 16:19; See Job 21:20 \x*the wine of God’s wrath, \x + \xo 14:10 \xt [ch. 18:6; Isa. 1:22] \x*poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and \x + \xo 14:10 \xt ch. 20:10\x*he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
\v 11 And \x + \xo 14:11 \xt Isa. 34:10; [ch. 18:18; 19:3; Gen. 19:28] \x*the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and \x + \xo 14:11 \xt ch. 4:8 \x*they have no rest, day or night, these \x + \xo 14:11 \xt [See ver. 9 above]\x*worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name.”
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 14:12 \xt ch. 13:10 \x*Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who \x + \xo 14:12 \xt ch. 12:17\x*keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.\f + \fr 14:12 \ft Greek \fq and the faith of Jesus\f*
\p
\v 13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: \x + \xo 14:13 \xt ch. 20:6; [Eccles. 4:2] \x*Blessed are the dead \x + \xo 14:13 \xt 1 Cor. 15:18; 1 Thess. 4:16 \x*who die in the Lord from now on.” “Blessed indeed,” says the Spirit, \x + \xo 14:13 \xt ch. 6:11\x*“that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!”
\s1 The Harvest of the Earth
\p
\v 14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one \x + \xo 14:14 \xt See ch. 1:13 \x*like a son of man, \x + \xo 14:14 \xt ch. 6:2\x*with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.
\v 15 And another angel \x + \xo 14:15 \xt [ch. 15:6; 16:17] \x*came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, \x + \xo 14:15 \xt ver. 18; Joel 3:13; Mark 4:29; [Matt. 13:39] \x*“Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for \x + \xo 14:15 \xt Jer. 51:33\x*the harvest of the earth is fully ripe.”
\v 16 So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped.
\p
\v 17 Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
\v 18 And another angel came out from the altar, \x + \xo 14:18 \xt [ch. 16:8] \x*the angel who has authority over the fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, “Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, \x + \xo 14:18 \xt Joel 3:13\x*for its grapes are ripe.”
\v 19 So the angel swung his sickle across the earth and gathered the grape harvest of the earth and threw it into the great \x + \xo 14:19 \xt ch. 19:15\x*winepress of the wrath of God.
\v 20 And \x + \xo 14:20 \xt Isa. 63:3; Lam. 1:15 \x*the winepress was trodden \x + \xo 14:20 \xt [Heb. 13:12] \x*outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress, as high as \x + \xo 14:20 \xt [ch. 19:14]\x*a horse’s bridle, for 1,600 stadia.\f + \fr 14:20 \ft About 184 miles; a \fq stadion \ft was about 607 feet or 185 meters\f*
\c 15
\s1 The Seven Angels with Seven Plagues
\p \v 1 Then \x + \xo 15:1 \xt [ch. 12:1, 3] \x*I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, \x + \xo 15:1 \xt ch. 16:1; 17:1; 21:9\x*seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.
\p
\v 2 And I saw \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 4:6; 21:18, 21 \x*what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire—and also those \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 12:11 \x*who had conquered the beast and its image and \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 13:17 \x*the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass \x + \xo 15:2 \xt ch. 5:8; 14:2\x*with harps of God in their hands.
\v 3 And they sing \x + \xo 15:3 \xt Ex. 15:1; Deut. 31:30 \x*the song of Moses, \x + \xo 15:3 \xt See Heb. 3:5 \x*the servant\f + \fr 15:3 \ft Greek \fq bondservant\f* of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying,

\p
\v 5 After this I looked, and \x + \xo 15:5 \xt ch. 11:19 \x*the sanctuary of \x + \xo 15:5 \xt Ex. 38:21; Num. 1:50; Acts 7:44\x*the tent\f + \fr 15:5 \ft Or \fq tabernacle\f* of witness in heaven was opened,

\v 7 And one of \x + \xo 15:7 \xt ch. 4:6 \x*the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven \x + \xo 15:7 \xt [ch. 5:8] \x*golden bowls full of the wrath of God \x + \xo 15:7 \xt ch. 1:18; 4:9; 5:13\x*who lives forever and ever,

\c 16
\s1 The Seven Bowls of God’s Wrath
\p \v 1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling \x + \xo 16:1 \xt See ch. 15:1 \x*the seven angels, “Go and \x + \xo 16:1 \xt Ps. 79:6; Jer. 10:25; Zeph. 3:8 \x*pour out on the earth \x + \xo 16:1 \xt ch. 15:7\x*the seven bowls of the wrath of God.”
\p
\v 2 So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful \x + \xo 16:2 \xt ver. 11; Ex. 9:9-11 \x*sores came upon the people who bore \x + \xo 16:2 \xt ch. 13:16\x*the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
\p
\v 3 The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and \x + \xo 16:3 \xt ch. 8:8 \x*it became like the blood of a corpse, and \x + \xo 16:3 \xt ch. 8:9\x*every living thing died that was in the sea.

\v 4 The woman \x + \xo 17:4 \xt ch. 18:16 \x*was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned \x + \xo 17:4 \xt Dan. 11:38 \x*with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand \x + \xo 17:4 \xt Jer. 51:7; [ch. 18:6]\x*a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.

\v 6 And I saw the woman, drunk \x + \xo 17:6 \xt ch. 16:6; [ch. 13:15] \x*with the blood of the saints, the blood of \x + \xo 17:6 \xt ch. 2:13\x*the martyrs of Jesus.\f + \fr 17:6 \ft Greek \fq the witnesses to Jesus\f*
\p When I saw her, I marveled greatly.

\v 8 The beast that you saw \x + \xo 17:8 \xt ver. 11; [ch. 1:4; 13:3] \x*was, and is not, and \x + \xo 17:8 \xt ch. 11:7 \x*is about to rise from \x + \xo 17:8 \xt See ch. 9:1 \x*the bottomless pit\f + \fr 17:8 \ft Greek \fq the abyss\f* and \x + \xo 17:8 \xt ch. 13:10 \x*go to destruction.

\v 11 As for the beast \x + \xo 17:11 \xt ver. 8; [ch. 11:17]\x*that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.

\v 13 These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.
\v 14 They \x + \xo 17:14 \xt See ch. 16:14 \x*will make war on the Lamb, and \x + \xo 17:14 \xt See ch. 3:21 \x*the Lamb will conquer them, for he is \x + \xo 17:14 \xt ch. 19:16; Deut. 10:17; Ps. 136:3; Dan. 2:47; 1 Tim. 6:15; [ch. 1:5; Matt. 28:18; Acts 10:36] \x*Lord of lords and \x + \xo 17:14 \xt ch. 19:16; Deut. 10:17; Ps. 136:3; Dan. 2:47; 1 Tim. 6:15; [ch. 1:5; Matt. 28:18; Acts 10:36] \x*King of kings, and those with him are \x + \xo 17:14 \xt See ch. 2:10; Luke 18:7 (Gk.); Rom. 1:6\x*called and chosen and faithful.”

After that he must be released for a little while.
\p
\v 4 Then I saw \x + \xo 20:4 \xt Dan. 7:9; Matt. 19:28 \x*thrones, and \x + \xo 20:4 \xt ch. 3:21; Dan. 7:22 \x*seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw \x + \xo 20:4 \xt ch. 6:9 \x*the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those \x + \xo 20:4 \xt ch. 13:12, 14-16 \x*who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. \x + \xo 20:4 \xt [John 14:19; 2 Tim. 2:11] \x*They came to life and \x + \xo 20:4 \xt ver. 6; ch. 5:10; 22:5; Dan. 7:18; Matt. 20:21, 27; 2 Tim. 2:12; [Ps. 45:16]\x*reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
\v 5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.

\s1 The Defeat of Satan

\v 7 And when the thousand years are ended, \x + \xo 20:7 \xt ver. 2\x*Satan will be released from his prison
\v 8 and will come out \x + \xo 20:8 \xt ver. 3, 10 \x*to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, \x + \xo 20:8 \xt Ezek. 38:2; 39:1 \x*Gog and Magog, \x + \xo 20:8 \xt See ch. 16:14\x*to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.
\v 9 And \x + \xo 20:9 \xt [Isa. 8:8; Ezek. 38:9, 16; Hab. 1:6] \x*they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded \x + \xo 20:9 \xt Heb. 13:11, 13 \x*the camp of the saints and \x + \xo 20:9 \xt [Ps. 132:13] \x*the beloved city, but \x + \xo 20:9 \xt See ch. 13:13\x*fire came down from heaven\f + \fr 20:9 \ft Some manuscripts \fq from God, out of heaven\ft , or \fq out of heaven from God\f* and consumed them,

\s1 Judgment Before the Great White Throne
\p
\v 11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence \x + \xo 20:11 \xt See Ps. 102:26 \x*earth and sky fled away, and \x + \xo 20:11 \xt ch. 12:8; Dan. 2:35\x*no place was found for them.
\v 12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and \x + \xo 20:12 \xt Dan. 7:10 \x*books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is \x + \xo 20:12 \xt See ch. 3:5 \x*the book of life. And \x + \xo 20:12 \xt Rom. 14:10; 2 Cor. 5:10; See ch. 11:18 \x*the dead were judged by what was written in the books, \x + \xo 20:12 \xt See Matt. 16:27\x*according to what they had done.
\v 13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, \x + \xo 20:13 \xt ch. 6:8 \x*Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, \x + \xo 20:13 \xt [See ver. 12 above]\x*according to what they had done.
\v 14 Then \x + \xo 20:14 \xt [See ver. 13 above] \x*Death and Hades \x + \xo 20:14 \xt [ch. 21:4; Luke 20:36; 1 Cor. 15:26] \x*were thrown into the lake of fire. This is \x + \xo 20:14 \xt ver. 6\x*the second death, the lake of fire.
\v 15 And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, \x + \xo 20:15 \xt Matt. 13:42, 50\x*he was thrown into the lake of fire.
\c 21
\s1 The New Heaven and the New Earth
\p \v 1 Then I saw \x + \xo 21:1 \xt Isa. 65:17; 66:22; 2 Pet. 3:13 \x*a new heaven and a new earth, for \x + \xo 21:1 \xt ch. 20:11\x*the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
\v 2 And I saw \x + \xo 21:2 \xt ch. 11:2; 22:19; Isa. 52:1 \x*the holy city, \x + \xo 21:2 \xt See ch. 3:12 \x*new Jerusalem, \x + \xo 21:2 \xt [Heb. 11:10] \x*coming down out of heaven from God, \x + \xo 21:2 \xt ch. 19:7; [John 14:3] \x*prepared \x + \xo 21:2 \xt Isa. 61:10\x*as a bride adorned for her husband.
\v 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Behold, \x + \xo 21:3 \xt See Lev. 26:11, 12 \x*the dwelling place\f + \fr 21:3 \ft Or \fq tabernacle\f* of God is with man. He will \x + \xo 21:3 \xt [ch. 7:15]\x*dwell with them, and they will be his people,\f + \fr 21:3 \ft Some manuscripts \fq peoples\f* and God himself will be with them as their God.\f + \fr 21:3 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq as their God\f*
\v 4 \x + \xo 21:4 \xt See ch. 7:17 \x*He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and \x + \xo 21:4 \xt [ch. 20:14; 1 Cor. 15:26] \x*death shall be no more, \x + \xo 21:4 \xt Isa. 35:10; 51:11; 65:19\x*neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”
\p
\v 5 And \x + \xo 21:5 \xt ch. 4:2, 9; 5:1; 20:11 \x*he who was seated on the throne said, “Behold, I \x + \xo 21:5 \xt See 2 Cor. 5:17 \x*am making all things new.” Also he said, “Write this down, for \x + \xo 21:5 \xt ch. 22:6; [ch. 3:14; 19:11; 1 Tim. 1:15]\x*these words are trustworthy and true.”
\v 6 And he said to me, \x + \xo 21:6 \xt See ch. 10:6 \x*“It is done! \x + \xo 21:6 \xt ch. 1:8; 22:13 \x*I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. \x + \xo 21:6 \xt ch. 22:17; See John 4:10; 7:37\x*To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.

\s1 The New Jerusalem
\p
\v 9 Then came \x + \xo 21:9 \xt ch. 17:1 \x*one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of \x + \xo 21:9 \xt ch. 15:1 \x*the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you \x + \xo 21:9 \xt ver. 2\x*the Bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
\v 10 And \x + \xo 21:10 \xt ch. 17:3; [Ezek. 43:5] \x*he carried me away in the Spirit to \x + \xo 21:10 \xt Ps. 87:1; Ezek. 40:2\x*a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
\v 11 \x + \xo 21:11 \xt ver. 23; [ch. 22:5; Ps. 84:11; Ezek. 43:2, 4] \x*having the glory of God, \x + \xo 21:11 \xt [Matt. 5:14; Phil. 2:15] \x*its radiance \x + \xo 21:11 \xt ch. 4:3, 6\x*like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
\v 12 It had a great, high wall, \x + \xo 21:12 \xt Ezek. 48:31-34\x*with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed—
\v 13 on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
\v 14 And the wall of the city had twelve \x + \xo 21:14 \xt Heb. 11:10; [1 Cor. 3:11] \x*foundations, and \x + \xo 21:14 \xt Matt. 16:18; Eph. 2:20\x*on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
\p
\v 15 And the one who spoke with me \x + \xo 21:15 \xt See ch. 11:1\x*had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.
\v 16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia.\f + \fr 21:16 \ft About 1,380 miles; a \fq stadion \ft was about 607 feet or 185 meters\f* Its length and width and height are equal.
\v 17 He also measured its wall, 144 cubits\f + \fr 21:17 \ft A \fq cubit \ft was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters\f* by \x + \xo 21:17 \xt Deut. 3:11; [ch. 13:18] \x*human measurement, which is also \x + \xo 21:17 \xt ver. 9\x*an angel’s measurement.
\v 18 The wall was built of \x + \xo 21:18 \xt ver. 11\x*jasper, while the city was pure gold, like \x + \xo 21:18 \xt ver. 11\x*clear glass.
\v 19 \x + \xo 21:19 \xt [Isa. 54:11, 12]\x*The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
\v 20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
\v 21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and \x + \xo 21:21 \xt ch. 22:2\x*the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.
\p
\v 22 And \x + \xo 21:22 \xt [John 4:23]\x*I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
\v 23 And the city \x + \xo 21:23 \xt ch. 22:5; Isa. 60:19, 20; [ver. 25] \x*has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for \x + \xo 21:23 \xt ver. 11\x*the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
\v 24 By its light \x + \xo 21:24 \xt Isa. 60:3; [ch. 22:2] \x*will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth \x + \xo 21:24 \xt ver. 26; [Isa. 60:5, 16]\x*will bring their glory into it,

\v 26 They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.
\v 27 But \x + \xo 21:27 \xt [ch. 22:14, 15; Isa. 35:8; 52:1; Ezek. 44:9; Joel 3:17; Zech. 14:21] \x*nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s \x + \xo 21:27 \xt See ch. 3:5\x*book of life.
