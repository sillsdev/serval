\v 5 Let the wise hear and \x + \xo 1:5 \xt ch. 9:9\x*increase in learning,

\q1
\v 6 to understand a proverb and a saying,

\s1 The Enticement of Sinners
\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ch. 6:20; [Ps. 34:11; Eph. 6:1, 2]\x*Hear, my son, your father’s instruction,
\q2 and forsake not your mother’s teaching,
\q1

\q2 and \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [Gen. 41:42; Dan. 5:29]\x*pendants for your neck.
\q1
\v 10 My son, if sinners \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 16:29\x*entice you,

\q1
\v 11 If they say, “Come with us, \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ver. 18; ch. 12:6; Jer. 5:26 \x*let us lie in wait for blood;
\q2 \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ver. 18; Ps. 10:8; 64:5\x*let us ambush the innocent without reason;

\v 12 like Sheol let us \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Ps. 124:3; [Num. 16:32, 33] \x*swallow them alive,
\q2 and whole, like \x + \xo 1:12 \xt Ps. 28:1\x*those who go down to the pit;

\q2 we will all have one purse”—
\q1
\v 15 my son, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt ch. 4:14; 24:1; Ps. 1:1 \x*do not walk in the way with them;
\q2 \x + \xo 1:15 \xt [Ps. 119:101]\x*hold back your foot from their paths,

\v 16 for \x + \xo 1:16 \xt ch. 6:18; Isa. 59:7; [Rom. 3:15]\x*their feet run to evil,
\q2 and they make haste to shed blood.
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17 \xt [Job 40:24]\x*For in vain is a net spread
\q2 in the sight of any bird,
\q1
\v 18 but these men \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ver. 11\x*lie in wait for their own blood;
\q2 they \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ver. 11\x*set an ambush for their own lives.
\q1
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19 \xt [Job 8:13] \x*Such are the ways of everyone who is \x + \xo 1:19 \xt ch. 15:27 \x*greedy for unjust gain;

\s1 The Call of Wisdom
\q1
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20 \xt ch. 8:1; 9:3; [John 7:37]\x*Wisdom cries aloud in the street,
\q2 in the markets she raises her voice;
\q1
\v 21 at the head of the noisy streets she cries out;
\q2 at \x + \xo 1:21 \xt ch. 8:3\x*the entrance of the city gates she speaks:
\q1
\v 22 “How long, O \x + \xo 1:22 \xt See ver. 4 \x*simple ones, will you love being simple?
\q1 How long will \x + \xo 1:22 \xt See Ps. 1:1 \x*scoffers delight in their scoffing
\q2 and fools \x + \xo 1:22 \xt ver. 29; ch. 5:12; [Job 21:14]\x*hate knowledge?
\q1
\v 23 If you turn at my reproof,\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Or \fq Will you turn away at my reproof?\f*
\q1 behold, I will \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Joel 2:28; Acts 2:17\x*pour out my spirit to you;
\q2 I will make my words known to you.
\q1
\v 24 \x + \xo 1:24 \xt Isa. 65:12; 66:4; Jer. 7:13 \x*Because I have called and \x + \xo 1:24 \xt Zech. 7:11 \x*you refused to listen,
\q2 have \x + \xo 1:24 \xt Rom. 10:21\x*stretched out my hand and no one has heeded,
\q1
\v 25 because you have \x + \xo 1:25 \xt See Ps. 107:11 \x*ignored all my counsel
\q2 and \x + \xo 1:25 \xt [Ps. 81:11; Luke 7:30]\x*would have none of my reproof,
\q1
\v 26 I also \x + \xo 1:26 \xt See Ps. 2:4 \x*will laugh at your calamity;
\q2 I will mock when \x + \xo 1:26 \xt ch. 10:24; Jer. 48:43; 49:5\x*terror strikes you,
\q1
\v 27 when terror strikes you like \x + \xo 1:27 \xt [Zeph. 1:15]\x*a storm
\q2 and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
\q2 when distress and anguish come upon you.
\q1
\v 28 \x + \xo 1:28 \xt See 1 Sam. 8:18; Job 27:9\x*Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer;
\q2 they will seek me diligently but will not find me.
\q1
\v 29 Because they \x + \xo 1:29 \xt [See ver. 22 above] \x*hated knowledge
\q2 and \x + \xo 1:29 \xt [Job 21:14]\x*did not choose the fear of the \nd Lord\nd*,
\q1
\v 30 \x + \xo 1:30 \xt [See ver. 25 above] \x*would have none of my counsel
\q2 and \x + \xo 1:30 \xt [See ver. 25 above]\x*despised all my reproof,
\q1
\v 31 therefore they shall eat \x + \xo 1:31 \xt Jer. 6:19 \x*the fruit of their way,
\q2 and have \x + \xo 1:31 \xt ch. 14:14; Isa. 3:11; [Job 4:8]\x*their fill of their own devices.
\q1
\v 32 For the simple are killed by \x + \xo 1:32 \xt Jer. 2:19 \x*their turning away,
\q2 and \x + \xo 1:32 \xt [Ps. 73:18, 19]\x*the complacency of fools destroys them;
\q1
\v 33 but \x + \xo 1:33 \xt [Ps. 25:12, 13] \x*whoever listens to me will dwell secure
\q2 and will be \x + \xo 1:33 \xt Ps. 112:7, 8\x*at ease, without dread of disaster.”

\s1 The Value of Wisdom
\q1
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1 \xt See ch. 1:8 \x*My son, \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [ch. 4:1, 10, 20; 7:1]\x*if you receive my words
\q2 and treasure up my commandments with you,
\q1
\v 2 making your ear attentive to wisdom
\q2 and inclining your heart to understanding;
\q1
\v 3 yes, if you call out for insight
\q2 and raise your voice \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 4:1, 5, 7\x*for understanding,
\q1
\v 4 if you seek it like \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ch. 3:14 \x*silver
\q2 and search for it as for \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Job 3:21; [Matt. 13:44]\x*hidden treasures,
\q1
\v 5 then \x + \xo 2:5 \xt [Ps. 25:14; John 7:17; 14:21]\x*you will understand the fear of the \nd Lord\nd*
\q2 and find the knowledge of God.
\q1
\v 6 For \x + \xo 2:6 \xt Job 32:8\x*the \nd Lord\nd* gives wisdom;
\q2 from his mouth come knowledge and understanding;
\q1
\v 7 he stores up sound wisdom for the upright;
\q2 he is \x + \xo 2:7 \xt ch. 30:5; See Ps. 3:3 \x*a shield to those who \x + \xo 2:7 \xt Ps. 84:11\x*walk in integrity,
\q1
\v 8 guarding the paths of justice
\q2 and \x + \xo 2:8 \xt 1 Sam. 2:9; Ps. 66:9; 97:10 \x*watching over the way of his \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See Ps. 30:4\x*saints.
\q1
\v 9 \x + \xo 2:9 \xt [ver. 5] \x*Then you will understand \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ch. 1:3\x*righteousness and justice
\q2 and equity, every good path;
\q1
\v 10 for wisdom will come into your heart,
\q2 and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul;
\q1
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 1:4 \x*discretion will \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ch. 6:22\x*watch over you,
\q2 understanding will guard you,
\q1
\v 12 delivering you from the way of evil,
\q2 from men of perverted speech,
\q1
\v 13 who forsake the paths of uprightness
\q2 to \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Ps. 82:5; [John 3:19, 20]\x*walk in the ways of darkness,
\q1
\v 14 who \x + \xo 2:14 \xt Jer. 11:15; [ch. 10:23] \x*rejoice in doing evil
\q2 and \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Ps. 50:18; Rom. 1:32]\x*delight in the perverseness of evil,
\q1
\v 15 men whose \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Ps. 125:5; [ch. 21:8] \x*paths are crooked,
\q2 \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ch. 14:2 \x*and who are \x + \xo 2:15 \xt ch. 3:32\x*devious in their ways.
\b
\q1
\v 16 So \x + \xo 2:16 \xt ch. 7:5 \x*you will be delivered from the forbidden\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebrew \fq strange\f* woman,
\q2 from \x + \xo 2:16 \xt ch. 6:24; 23:27 \x*the adulteress\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Hebrew \fq foreign woman\f* with \x + \xo 2:16 \xt ch. 6:24; Ps. 5:9\x*her smooth words,
\q1
\v 17 who forsakes \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Jer. 3:4; [Ps. 55:13] \x*the companion of her youth
\q2 and forgets \x + \xo 2:17 \xt [Mal. 2:14, 15]\x*the covenant of her God;
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ch. 7:27\x*for her house sinks down to death,
\q2 and her paths to the departed;\f + \fr 2:18 \ft Hebrew \fq to the Rephaim\f*
\q1
\v 19 none who go to her come back,
\q2 nor do they regain the paths of life.
\b
\q1
\v 20 So you will walk in the way of the good
\q2 and keep to the paths of the righteous.
\q1
\v 21 For the upright \x + \xo 2:21 \xt ch. 10:30\x*will inhabit the land,
\q2 and those with integrity will remain in it,
\q1
\v 22 but the wicked will be \x + \xo 2:22 \xt See Ps. 37:38 \x*cut off from the land,
\q2 and the treacherous will be \x + \xo 2:22 \xt ch. 15:25; Deut. 28:63; Ps. 52:5\x*rooted out of it.

\q1
\v 6 In all your ways \x + \xo 3:6 \xt 1 Chr. 28:9 \x*acknowledge him,

\q1
\v 8 It will be \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [ch. 4:22] \x*healing to your flesh\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Hebrew \fq navel\f*
\q2 and \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See Job 21:24\x*refreshment\f + \fr 3:8 \ft Or \fq medicine\f* to your bones.

\b
\q1
\v 11 \x + \xo 3:11 \xt Cited Heb. 12:5, 6; See Job 5:17\x*My son, do not despise the \nd Lord\nd*’s discipline
\q2 or be weary of his reproof,
\q1
\v 12 for the \nd Lord\nd* reproves him whom he loves,
\q2 as \x + \xo 3:12 \xt Deut. 8:5; [1 Cor. 11:32]\x*a father the son in whom he delights.
\s1 Blessed Is the One Who Finds Wisdom
