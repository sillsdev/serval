\s1 The Word Became Flesh
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Gen. 1:1; [Col. 1:17; 1 John 1:1; Rev. 1:4, 8, 17; 3:14; 21:6; 22:13] \x*In the beginning was \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Rev. 19:13; [Heb. 4:12; 1 John 1:1] \x*the Word, and \x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 John 1:2; [ch. 17:5] \x*the Word was with God, and \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Phil. 2:6\x*the Word was God.
\v 2 He was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3 \xt ver. 10; Ps. 33:6; 1 Cor. 8:6; Col. 1:16; Heb. 1:2\x*All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4 \xt ch. 5:26; 11:25; 1 John 1:2; 5:11 \x*In him was life,\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or \fq was not any thing made. That which has been made was life in him\f* and \x + \xo 1:4 \xt ch. 8:12; 9:5; 12:46\x*the life was the light of men.
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [ch. 3:19]\x*The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.
\p
\v 6 There was a man \x + \xo 1:6 \xt ver. 33; ch. 3:28; Mal. 3:1 \x*sent from God, whose name was \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Matt. 3:1; Mark 1:4; Luke 3:2\x*John.
\v 7 He came as a \x + \xo 1:7 \xt ch. 3:26; 5:33 \x*witness, to bear witness about the light, \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Acts 19:4\x*that all might believe through him.
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt ver. 20\x*He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9 \xt Isa. 49:6; 1 John 2:8\x*The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [ch. 16:3; 1 John 3:1]\x*the world did not know him.
\v 11 He came to \x + \xo 1:11 \xt Matt. 21:38 \x*his own,\f + \fr 1:11 \ft Greek \fq to his own things\ft ; that is, to his own domain, or to his own people\f* and \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ch. 13:1 \x*his own people\f + \fr 1:11 \fq People \ft is implied in Greek\f* \x + \xo 1:11 \xt ch. 5:43; [ch. 3:11, 32]\x*did not receive him.
\v 12 But to all who did receive him, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt See 1 John 5:13 \x*who believed in his name, \x + \xo 1:12 \xt 1 John 5:1 \x*he gave the right \x + \xo 1:12 \xt 1 John 3:1; [Matt. 5:45] \x*to become \x + \xo 1:12 \xt [Gal. 3:26]; See ch. 11:52\x*children of God,
\v 13 who \x + \xo 1:13 \xt James 1:18; [ch. 3:3; 1 Pet. 1:3] \x*were born, \x + \xo 1:13 \xt 1 Pet. 1:23 \x*not of blood \x + \xo 1:13 \xt ch. 3:6\x*nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.
\p
\v 14 And \x + \xo 1:14 \xt ver. 1 \x*the Word \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Rom. 1:3; 8:3; Gal. 4:4; Phil. 2:7, 8; Col. 1:22; 1 Tim. 3:16; Heb. 2:14; 1 John 4:2; 2 John 7; [ch. 6:51] \x*became flesh and \x + \xo 1:14 \xt Rev. 7:15; 21:3 \x*dwelt among us, \x + \xo 1:14 \xt ch. 2:11; Luke 9:32; 2 Pet. 1:16, 17; 1 John 1:1; 4:14 \x*and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of \x + \xo 1:14 \xt See ver. 7 \x*grace and \x + \xo 1:14 \xt [ch. 14:6]\x*truth.
\v 15 (\x + \xo 1:15 \xt See ver. 7 \x*John bore witness about him, and cried out, “This was he of whom I said, \x + \xo 1:15 \xt ver. 27, 30; See Matt. 3:11\x*‘He who comes after me ranks before me, because he was before me.’”)
\v 16 For from \x + \xo 1:16 \xt Eph. 1:23; 3:19; 4:13; Col. 1:19; 2:9 \x*his fullness we have all received, \x + \xo 1:16 \xt [Matt. 25:29]\x*grace upon grace.\f + \fr 1:16 \ft Or \fq grace in place of grace\f*
\v 17 For \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ch. 7:19; Ex. 20:1 \x*the law was given through Moses; \x + \xo 1:17 \xt ver. 14; [Rom. 5:21]\x*grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ch. 5:37; 6:46; Ex. 33:20; Col. 1:15; 1 Tim. 6:16; 1 John 4:12, 20; [ch. 12:45] \x*No one has ever seen God; \x + \xo 1:18 \xt ver. 14; See ch. 3:16 \x*the only God,\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Or \fq the only One, who is God\ft ; some manuscripts \fq the only Son\f* who is at the Father’s side,\f + \fr 1:18 \ft Greek \fq in the bosom of the Father\f* \x + \xo 1:18 \xt [Matt. 11:27]; See ch. 3:32\x*he has made him known.
\s1 The Testimony of John the Baptist
\p
\v 19 And this is the \x + \xo 1:19 \xt ch. 3:26 \x*testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, \x + \xo 1:19 \xt [ch. 8:25]\x*“Who are you?”
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20 \xt ver. 8; ch. 3:28; Acts 13:25; [Luke 3:15]\x*He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, “I am not the Christ.”
\v 21 And they asked him, “What then? \x + \xo 1:21 \xt [Matt. 11:14; 16:14] \x*Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not.” “Are you \x + \xo 1:21 \xt See Deut. 18:15, 18\x*the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”
\v 22 So they said to him, “Who are you? We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
\v 23 He said, “I am \x + \xo 1:23 \xt Cited from Isa. 40:3; See Matt. 3:3\x*the voice of one crying out in the wilderness, ‘Make straight\f + \fr 1:23 \ft Or \fq crying out, ‘In the wilderness make straight\f* the way of the Lord,’ as the prophet Isaiah said.”
\p
\v 24 (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.)
\v 25 They asked him, \x + \xo 1:25 \xt Matt. 3:6; Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3, 7\x*“Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”
\v 26 John answered them, \x + \xo 1:26 \xt Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:7, 8; Luke 3:16; Acts 1:5; 13:25\x*“I baptize with water, but among you stands one you do not know,
\v 27 even \x + \xo 1:27 \xt ver. 15, 30\x*he who comes after me, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.”
\v 28 These things took place in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\s1 Behold, the Lamb of God
\p
\v 29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, “Behold, \x + \xo 1:29 \xt ver. 36; Ex. 12:3; Isa. 53:7; Acts 8:32; 1 Pet. 1:19; [Gen. 22:8; Rev. 5:6] \x*the Lamb of God, who \x + \xo 1:29 \xt 1 John 3:5; [Heb. 10:4, 11] \x*takes away the sin \x + \xo 1:29 \xt [ch. 3:16, 17; 4:42; 12:47; 1 John 2:2; 4:14]\x*of the world!
\v 30 This is he of whom I said, \x + \xo 1:30 \xt ver. 15, 27\x*‘After me comes a man who ranks before me, because he was before me.’
\v 31 I myself did not know him, but \x + \xo 1:31 \xt Luke 1:17, 76, 77\x*for this purpose I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.”
\v 32 And John \x + \xo 1:32 \xt See ver. 7 \x*bore witness: \x + \xo 1:32 \xt Matt. 3:16; Mark 1:10; Luke 3:22 \x*“I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove, and \x + \xo 1:32 \xt [Isa. 11:2; Acts 10:38]\x*it remained on him.
\v 33 I myself did not know him, but \x + \xo 1:33 \xt ver. 6; Luke 3:2 \x*he who sent me to baptize \x + \xo 1:33 \xt [ch. 3:5] \x*with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, \x + \xo 1:33 \xt Matt. 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; Acts 1:5\x*this is he who baptizes \x + \xo 1:33 \xt [ch. 3:5] \x*with the Holy Spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.”
\s1 Jesus Calls the First Disciples
\p
\v 35 The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples,
\v 36 and he looked at Jesus as he walked by and said, “Behold, \x + \xo 1:36 \xt See ver. 29\x*the Lamb of God!”
\v 37 The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 Jesus turned and saw them following and said to them, \x + \xo 1:38 \xt ch. 18:4, 7; 20:15 \x*\wj “What are you seeking?”\wj* And they said to him, \x + \xo 1:38 \xt ver. 49; ch. 3:2, 26; 6:25; [ch. 20:16; Mark 10:51]\x*“Rabbi” (which means Teacher), “where are you staying?”
\v 39 He said to them, \wj “Come and you will see.”\wj* So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.\f + \fr 1:39 \ft That is, about 4 \sc p.m.\sc*\f*
\v 40 \x + \xo 1:40 \xt For ver. 40-42, [Matt. 4:18-22; Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:2-11]\x*One of the two who heard John speak and followed Jesus\f + \fr 1:40 \ft Greek \fq him\f* was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother.
\v 41 He first found his own brother Simon and said to him, “We have found \x + \xo 1:41 \xt ch. 4:25\x*the Messiah” (which means Christ).
\v 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, \wj “You are Simon the son of \wj*\x + \xo 1:42 \xt ch. 21:15-17 \x*\wj John. You shall be called \wj*\x + \xo 1:42 \xt 1 Cor. 1:12; 3:22 \x*\wj Cephas”\wj* (which means \x + \xo 1:42 \xt Matt. 16:18\x*Peter\f + \fr 1:42 \fq Cephas \ft and \fq Peter \ft are from the word for \fq rock \ft in Aramaic and Greek, respectively\f*).
\s1 Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael
\p
\v 43 \x + \xo 1:43 \xt [ver. 35; ch. 2:1] \x*The next day Jesus decided \x + \xo 1:43 \xt [ver. 28]\x*to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, \wj “Follow me.”\wj*
\v 44 Now \x + \xo 1:44 \xt ch. 12:21\x*Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip found \x + \xo 1:45 \xt ch. 21:2 \x*Nathanael and said to him, “We have found him of whom \x + \xo 1:45 \xt See Luke 16:16; 24:27 \x*Moses in the Law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus \x + \xo 1:45 \xt See Matt. 2:23 \x*of Nazareth, \x + \xo 1:45 \xt ch. 6:42; Luke 3:23\x*the son of Joseph.”
\v 46 Nathanael said to him, \x + \xo 1:46 \xt [ch. 7:41, 52]\x*“Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip said to him, “Come and see.”
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said of him, \wj “Behold, \wj*\x + \xo 1:47 \xt Ps. 73:1; Rom. 9:4, 6 \x*\wj an Israelite indeed, \wj*\x + \xo 1:47 \xt Ps. 32:2; [Zeph. 3:13; Rev. 14:5]\x*\wj in whom there is no deceit!”\wj*
\v 48 Nathanael said to him, “How \x + \xo 1:48 \xt ch. 2:24, 25\x*do you know me?” Jesus answered him, \wj “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.”\wj*
\v 49 Nathanael answered him, \x + \xo 1:49 \xt See ver. 38 \x*“Rabbi, \x + \xo 1:49 \xt [ch. 6:69; 11:27; 20:28] \x*you are the Son of God! You are the \x + \xo 1:49 \xt ch. 12:13; Zeph. 3:15; Matt. 27:11, 42; [Zech. 9:9]\x*King of Israel!”
\v 50 Jesus answered him, \wj “Because I said to you, ‘I saw you under the fig tree,’ do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”\wj*
\v 51 And he said to him, \wj “Truly, truly, I say to you,\wj*\f + \fr 1:51 \ft The Greek for \fq you \ft is plural; twice in this verse\f*\wj you will see \wj*\x + \xo 1:51 \xt Ezek. 1:1; Matt. 3:16; Luke 3:21 \x*\wj heaven opened, and \wj*\x + \xo 1:51 \xt [Gen. 28:12] \x*\wj the angels of God ascending and descending on \wj*\x + \xo 1:51 \xt See Dan. 7:13\x*\wj the Son of Man.”\wj*

\s1 The Wedding at Cana
\p
\v 1 On \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [ch. 1:29, 35, 43] \x*the third day there was a wedding at \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ch. 4:46; 21:2\x*Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
\v 2 Jesus also was invited to the wedding with \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ch. 1:40-49\x*his disciples.
\v 3 When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.”
\v 4 And Jesus said to her, \x + \xo 2:4 \xt ch. 19:26 \x*\wj “Woman, \wj*\x + \xo 2:4 \xt See 2 Sam. 16:10 \x*\wj what does this have to do with me? \wj*\x + \xo 2:4 \xt ch. 7:30; 8:20; 13:1\x*\wj My hour has not yet come.”\wj*
\v 5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six stone water jars there \x + \xo 2:6 \xt ch. 3:25; [Mark 7:3, 4] \x*for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty \x + \xo 2:6 \xt 2 Chr. 4:5 (Gk.)\x*gallons.\f + \fr 2:6 \ft Greek \fq two or three measures \ft (\+tl metrētas\+tl*); a \+tl metrētēs\+tl* was about 10 gallons or 35 liters\f*
\v 7 Jesus said to the servants, \wj “Fill the jars with water.”\wj* And they filled them up to the brim.
\v 8 And he said to them, \wj “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the feast.”\wj* So they took it.
\v 9 When the master of the feast tasted \x + \xo 2:9 \xt ch. 4:46\x*the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom
\v 10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then the poor wine. But you have kept the good wine until now.”
\v 11 This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested \x + \xo 2:11 \xt See ch. 1:14 \x*his glory. And \x + \xo 2:11 \xt ver. 2\x*his disciples believed in him.
\p
\v 12 After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See Matt. 12:46\x*his brothers\f + \fr 2:12 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to \fq brothers \ft or to \fq brothers and sisters\f* and his disciples, and they stayed there for a few days.
\s1 Jesus Cleanses the Temple
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ch. 11:55; See ch. 6:4 \x*The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus \x + \xo 2:13 \xt ver. 23; Deut. 16:1-6; Luke 2:41\x*went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14 \xt For ver. 14-17, [Matt. 21:12, 13; Mark 11:15-17; Luke 19:45, 46, with Mal. 3:1-3]\x*In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.
\v 15 And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.
\v 16 And he told those who sold the pigeons, \wj “Take these things away; do not make \wj*\x + \xo 2:16 \xt [ch. 14:2; Luke 2:49]\x*\wj my Father’s house a house of trade.”\wj*
\v 17 His disciples remembered that it was written, \x + \xo 2:17 \xt Cited from Ps. 69:9\x*“Zeal for your house will consume me.”
\p
\v 18 So the Jews said to him, \x + \xo 2:18 \xt ch. 4:48; 6:30; [Ex. 4:1, 8; 7:9]; See Matt. 12:38\x*“What sign do you show us for doing these things?”
\v 19 Jesus answered them, \x + \xo 2:19 \xt [Matt. 26:61; 27:40; Mark 14:58; 15:29] \x*\wj “Destroy this temple, and in three days \wj*\x + \xo 2:19 \xt ch. 10:18\x*\wj I will raise it up.”\wj*
\v 20 The Jews then said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple,\f + \fr 2:20 \ft Or \fq This temple was built forty-six years ago\f* and will you raise it up in three days?”
\v 21 But he was speaking about \x + \xo 2:21 \xt [ch. 1:14; 1 Cor. 6:19; Col. 2:9]\x*the temple of his body.
\v 22 When therefore he was raised from the dead, \x + \xo 2:22 \xt ch. 12:16; Luke 24:8 \x*his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed \x + \xo 2:22 \xt ch. 20:9; Ps. 16:10\x*the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.
\s1 Jesus Knows What Is in Man
\p
\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name \x + \xo 2:23 \xt ch. 11:45\x*when they saw the signs that he was doing.
\v 24 But Jesus \x + \xo 2:24 \xt [ch. 6:14, 15] \x*on his part did not entrust himself to them, because \x + \xo 2:24 \xt ch. 1:48; 5:42; 16:30; [ch. 6:61, 64]; See Matt. 9:4\x*he knew all people
\v 25 and needed no one to bear witness about man, for \x + \xo 2:25 \xt [See ver. 24 above]\x*he himself knew what was in man.
\c 3
\s1 You Must Be Born Again
\p
\v 1 Now there was a man of the Pharisees named \x + \xo 3:1 \xt ch. 7:50; 19:39 \x*Nicodemus, \x + \xo 3:1 \xt See Luke 24:20\x*a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 This man came to Jesus\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Greek \fq him\f* \x + \xo 3:2 \xt [ch. 12:42] \x*by night and said to him, \x + \xo 3:2 \xt See ch. 1:38 \x*“Rabbi, \x + \xo 3:2 \xt [ch. 9:29; Matt. 22:16] \x*we know that you are a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that you do \x + \xo 3:2 \xt Acts 10:38; [ch. 5:36; 9:33; Acts 2:22]\x*unless God is with him.”
\v 3 Jesus answered him, \wj “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is \wj*\x + \xo 3:3 \xt See ch. 1:13 \x*\wj born \wj*\x + \xo 3:3 \xt [2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; 1 Pet. 1:3, 23] \x*\wj again\wj*\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or \fq from above\ft ; the Greek is purposely ambiguous and can mean both \fq again \ft and \fq from above\ft ; also verse 7\f*\wj he cannot \wj*\x + \xo 3:3 \xt ver. 36\x*\wj see the kingdom of God.”\wj*
\v 4 Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”
\v 5 Jesus answered, \wj “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born \wj*\x + \xo 3:5 \xt [Ezek. 36:25-27; Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38; Eph. 5:26; Titus 3:5; Heb. 10:22]\x*\wj of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.\wj*
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6 \xt 1 Cor. 15:50 \x*\wj That which is born of the flesh is \wj*\x + \xo 3:6 \xt ch. 6:63\x*\wj flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.\wj*\f + \fr 3:6 \ft The same Greek word means both \fq wind \ft and \fq spirit\f*
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7 \xt ch. 5:28 \x*\wj Do not marvel that I said to you, ‘You\wj*\f + \fr 3:7 \ft The Greek for \fq you \ft is plural here\f*\wj must be born \wj*\x + \xo 3:7 \xt See ver. 3\x*\wj again.’\wj*
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8 \xt [Eccles. 11:5; Ezek. 37:9] \x*\wj The wind\wj*\f + \fr 3:8 \ft The same Greek word means both \fq wind \ft and \fq spirit\f*\wj blows \wj*\x + \xo 3:8 \xt 1 Cor. 12:11\x*\wj where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”\wj*
\p
\v 9 Nicodemus said to him, \x + \xo 3:9 \xt ch. 6:52, 60\x*“How can these things be?”
\v 10 Jesus answered him, \wj “Are you the teacher of Israel \wj*\x + \xo 3:10 \xt [ch. 9:30]\x*\wj and yet you do not understand these things?\wj*

\s1 Jesus and the Woman of Samaria
\p
\v 1 Now when Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and \x + \xo 4:1 \xt ch. 3:22, 26\x*baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 (although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),
\v 3 he left Judea and departed \x + \xo 4:3 \xt ch. 2:11, 12\x*again for Galilee.
\v 4 \x + \xo 4:4 \xt [Luke 13:33]\x*And he had to pass through Samaria.
\v 5 So he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the field \x + \xo 4:5 \xt ver. 12; Gen. 33:19; 48:22; Josh. 24:32\x*that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
\v 6 Jacob’s well was there; so Jesus, \x + \xo 4:6 \xt ch. 19:28; [Matt. 4:2; 8:24; 21:18]\x*wearied as he was from his journey, was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.\f + \fr 4:6 \ft That is, about noon\f*
\p
\v 7 A woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, \x + \xo 4:7 \xt [See ver. 6 above]\x*\wj “Give me a drink.”\wj*
\v 8 (For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.)
\v 9 The Samaritan woman said to him, “How is it that you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria?” (\x + \xo 4:9 \xt Luke 9:53; [ch. 8:48; Ezra 4:3, 10]; See Matt. 10:5\x*For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)
\v 10 Jesus answered her, \wj “If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, ‘Give me a drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you \wj*\x + \xo 4:10 \xt ch. 7:38; Jer. 2:13; 17:13\x*\wj living water.”\wj*
\v 11 The woman said to him, “Sir, you have nothing to draw water with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12 \xt [ch. 8:53] \x*Are you greater than our father Jacob? \x + \xo 4:12 \xt ver. 5\x*He gave us the well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock.”

\v 15 The woman said to him, “Sir, \x + \xo 4:15 \xt [ch. 6:34]\x*give me this water, so that I will not be thirsty or have to come here to draw water.”
\p
\v 16 Jesus said to her, \wj “Go, \wj*\x + \xo 4:16 \xt ch. 16:8\x*\wj call your husband, and come here.”\wj*
\v 17 The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, \wj “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’;\wj*
\v 18 \wj for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.”\wj*
\v 19 The woman said to him, “Sir, I perceive that \x + \xo 4:19 \xt ch. 9:17; [ch. 6:14] \x*you are \x + \xo 4:19 \xt Luke 7:16, 39; See Matt. 21:11\x*a prophet.

\v 21 Jesus said to her, \x + \xo 4:21 \xt ch. 2:4 \x*\wj “Woman, believe me, \wj*\x + \xo 4:21 \xt ver. 23; ch. 5:25, 28; 16:2, 25, 32 \x*\wj the hour is coming when \wj*\x + \xo 4:21 \xt Zeph. 2:11; Mal. 1:11; 1 Tim. 2:8\x*\wj neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.\wj*

\v 24 \wj God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.”\wj*
\v 25 The woman said to him, “I know that \x + \xo 4:25 \xt See ch. 1:41 \x*Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ). When he comes, \x + \xo 4:25 \xt Deut. 18:18; [ver. 29]\x*he will tell us all things.”
\v 26 Jesus said to her, \x + \xo 4:26 \xt ch. 9:35-37\x*\wj “I who speak to you am he.”\wj*
\p
\v 27 Just then \x + \xo 4:27 \xt ver. 8\x*his disciples came back. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, “What do you seek?” or, “Why are you talking with her?”
\v 28 So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people,
\v 29 “Come, see a man \x + \xo 4:29 \xt ver. 17, 18; [ver. 25]\x*who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?”
\v 30 They went out of the town and were coming to him.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, saying, \x + \xo 4:31 \xt See ch. 1:38\x*“Rabbi, eat.”
\v 32 But he said to them, \wj “I have food to eat that you do not know about.”\wj*
\v 33 So the disciples said to one another, \x + \xo 4:33 \xt [ver. 11, 15; ch. 3:4; 6:34, 52]\x*“Has anyone brought him something to eat?”
\v 34 Jesus said to them, \x + \xo 4:34 \xt [Job 23:12] \x*\wj “My food is \wj*\x + \xo 4:34 \xt ch. 5:30; 6:38; 14:31 \x*\wj to do the will of him who sent me and \wj*\x + \xo 4:34 \xt ch. 5:36; 17:4\x*\wj to accomplish his work.\wj*
\v 35 \wj Do you not say, ‘There are yet four months, then comes the harvest’? Look, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see that \wj*\x + \xo 4:35 \xt Matt. 9:37; Luke 10:2; [ver. 25, 30]\x*\wj the fields are white for harvest.\wj*

\v 37 \wj For here the saying holds true, \wj*\x + \xo 4:37 \xt [Job 31:8]\x*\wj ‘One sows and another reaps.’\wj*
\v 38 \wj I sent you to reap \wj*\x + \xo 4:38 \xt Josh. 24:13 \x*\wj that for which you did not labor. Others have labored, \wj*\x + \xo 4:38 \xt [Acts 8:5-17, 25]\x*\wj and you have entered into their labor.”\wj*
\p
\v 39 Many Samaritans \x + \xo 4:39 \xt ver. 5, 8 \x*from that town believed in him \x + \xo 4:39 \xt [ch. 17:20] \x*because of \x + \xo 4:39 \xt ver. 29\x*the woman’s testimony, “He told me all that I ever did.”
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
\v 41 And many more believed \x + \xo 4:41 \xt ch. 8:30\x*because of his word.
\v 42 They said to the woman, “It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, \x + \xo 4:42 \xt [1 John 5:20] \x*and we know that this is indeed \x + \xo 4:42 \xt 1 John 4:14; [ch. 3:17; 12:47; 1 Tim. 4:10] \x*the Savior \x + \xo 4:42 \xt See ch. 1:29\x*of the world.”
\p
\v 43 After \x + \xo 4:43 \xt ver. 40\x*the two days he departed for Galilee.
\v 44 (For Jesus himself had testified \x + \xo 4:44 \xt See Matt. 13:57\x*that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.)
\v 45 So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, \x + \xo 4:45 \xt ch. 2:23; 3:2 \x*having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast. For \x + \xo 4:45 \xt ver. 20\x*they too had gone to the feast.

\v 46 So he came again to \x + \xo 4:46 \xt ch. 2:1 \x*Cana in Galilee, \x + \xo 4:46 \xt ch. 2:9\x*where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was ill.
\v 47 When this man heard that Jesus \x + \xo 4:47 \xt ver. 3, 54\x*had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.

\v 53 The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, \wj “Your son will live.”\wj* And he himself believed, \x + \xo 4:53 \xt Acts 16:34; 18:8; See Acts 11:14\x*and all his household.

\s1 The Healing at the Pool on the Sabbath
\p
\v 1 After this there was a \x + \xo 5:1 \xt See ch. 6:4\x*feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Now there is in Jerusalem by \x + \xo 5:2 \xt Neh. 3:1, 32; 12:39\x*the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic\f + \fr 5:2 \ft Or \fq Hebrew\f* called Bethesda,\f + \fr 5:2 \ft Some manuscripts \fq Bethsaida\f* which has five roofed colonnades.
\v 3 In these lay a multitude of invalids—blind, lame, and \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Matt. 12:10\x*paralyzed.\f + \fr 5:3 \ft Some manuscripts insert, wholly or in part, \fq waiting for the moving of the water; \fv 4\fq for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and stirred the water: whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had\f*
\v 5 One man was there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.
\v 6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he said to him, \wj “Do you want to be healed?”\wj*
\v 7 The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up, and while I am going another steps down before me.”
\v 8 Jesus said to him, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Matt. 9:6, 7; Mark 2:9, 11, 12; Luke 5:24, 25\x*\wj “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.”\wj*
\v 9 \x + \xo 5:9 \xt [See ver. 8 above] \x*And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked.
\p \x + \xo 5:9 \xt ch. 9:14\x*Now that day was the Sabbath.
\v 10 So the Jews\f + \fr 5:10 \ft The Greek word \+tl Ioudaioi\+tl* refers specifically here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, who opposed Jesus in that time; also verses 15, 16, 18\f* said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and \x + \xo 5:10 \xt Ex. 20:10; Neh. 13:19; Jer. 17:21, 22; [ch. 7:23; 9:16; Matt. 12:2; Mark 2:24; 3:4; Luke 6:2; 13:14]\x*it is not lawful for you to take up your bed.”
\v 11 But he answered them, “The man who healed me, that man said to me, \wj ‘Take up your bed, and walk.’\wj*”
\v 12 They asked him, “Who is the man who said to you, ‘Take up your bed and walk’?”
\v 13 Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for \x + \xo 5:13 \xt [ch. 6:15]\x*Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.
\v 14 Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, \wj “See, you are well! \wj*\x + \xo 5:14 \xt [ch. 8:11] \x*\wj Sin no more, \wj*\x + \xo 5:14 \xt [Ezra 9:14]\x*\wj that nothing worse may happen to you.”\wj*
\v 15 The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.
\v 16 And this was why the Jews \x + \xo 5:16 \xt ch. 15:20; [Acts 9:4, 5] \x*were persecuting Jesus, \x + \xo 5:16 \xt ch. 7:23; 9:16\x*because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
\v 17 But Jesus answered them, \wj “My Father is working until now, and I am working.”\wj*
\s1 Jesus Is Equal with God
\p
\v 18 This was why the Jews \x + \xo 5:18 \xt See ch. 7:1 \x*were seeking all the more to kill him, \x + \xo 5:18 \xt See ch. 10:33 \x*because not only was he \x + \xo 5:18 \xt ver. 16 \x*breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God \x + \xo 5:18 \xt [Rom. 8:32] \x*his own Father, \x + \xo 5:18 \xt Phil. 2:6\x*making himself equal with God.

\v 19 So Jesus said to them, \wj “Truly, truly, I say to you, \wj*\x + \xo 5:19 \xt See ver. 30 \x*\wj the Son \wj*\x + \xo 5:19 \xt [ch. 16:13]\x*\wj can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing.

\v 21 \wj For as the Father \wj*\x + \xo 5:21 \xt [Deut. 32:39; 2 Cor. 1:9] \x*\wj raises the dead and \wj*\x + \xo 5:21 \xt Rom. 4:17; 8:11 \x*\wj gives them life, so \wj*\x + \xo 5:21 \xt [ch. 6:33; 11:25]; See 1 Cor. 15:45 \x*\wj also the Son gives life \wj*\x + \xo 5:21 \xt [Rom. 9:18]\x*\wj to whom he will.\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 5:22 \xt [Acts 17:31] \x*\wj The Father judges no one, but \wj*\x + \xo 5:22 \xt ver. 27; ch. 9:39; Acts 10:42; [ch. 3:17]; See ch. 17:2\x*\wj has given all judgment to the Son,\wj*
\v 23 \wj that all may honor the Son, just as they \wj*\x + \xo 5:23 \xt ch. 8:49 \x*\wj honor the Father. \wj*\x + \xo 5:23 \xt Luke 10:16; [ch. 15:23; 1 John 2:23]\x*\wj Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.\wj*
\v 24 \wj Truly, truly, I say to you, \wj*\x + \xo 5:24 \xt [ch. 8:51] \x*\wj whoever hears my word and \wj*\x + \xo 5:24 \xt ch. 20:31; 1 John 5:9-13; [ch. 3:15, 36; 12:44] \x*\wj believes him who sent me has eternal life. He \wj*\x + \xo 5:24 \xt ch. 3:18; [ver. 29] \x*\wj does not come into judgment, but \wj*\x + \xo 5:24 \xt 1 John 3:14\x*\wj has passed from death to life.\wj*
\p
\v 25 \wj “Truly, truly, I say to you, \wj*\x + \xo 5:25 \xt See ch. 4:21, 23 \x*\wj an hour is coming, and is now here, when \wj*\x + \xo 5:25 \xt See Eph. 2:1, 5 \x*\wj the dead will hear \wj*\x + \xo 5:25 \xt [ch. 11:43]\x*\wj the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear \wj*\x + \xo 5:25 \xt See Eph. 2:1, 5 \x*\wj will live.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 5:26 \xt [ch. 6:57] \x*\wj For as the Father has life in himself, \wj*\x + \xo 5:26 \xt See ch. 1:4; 17:2\x*\wj so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself.\wj*
\v 27 \wj And he \wj*\x + \xo 5:27 \xt ver. 22\x*\wj has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.\wj*
\v 28 \wj Do not marvel at this, for \wj*\x + \xo 5:28 \xt [See ver. 25 above] \x*\wj an hour is coming when \wj*\x + \xo 5:28 \xt ch. 11:24; 1 Cor. 15:52; [ch. 11:44, 45]\x*\wj all who are in the tombs will hear his voice\wj*
\v 29 \wj and come out, \wj*\x + \xo 5:29 \xt See Dan. 12:2\x*\wj those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment.\wj*

\s1 Jesus Feeds the Five Thousand
\p
\v 1 After this \x + \xo 6:1 \xt For ver. 1-13, see Matt. 14:13-21; Mark 6:32-44; Luke 9:10-17 \x*Jesus went away to the other side of \x + \xo 6:1 \xt See Matt. 4:18 \x*the Sea of Galilee, which is \x + \xo 6:1 \xt ch. 21:1\x*the Sea of Tiberias.
\v 2 And a large crowd was following him, because they saw the signs that he was doing on the sick.
\v 3 Jesus went up on \x + \xo 6:3 \xt ver. 15\x*the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.
\v 4 Now \x + \xo 6:4 \xt ch. 2:13; 11:55; See Ex. 12 \x*the Passover, the \x + \xo 6:4 \xt ch. 5:1; 7:2\x*feast of the Jews, was at hand.
\v 5 \x + \xo 6:5 \xt Luke 6:20 \x*Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward him, Jesus said to \x + \xo 6:5 \xt ch. 1:44\x*Philip, \wj “Where are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?”\wj*
\v 6 He said this to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.
\v 7 \x + \xo 6:7 \xt [Mark 6:37]\x*Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii\f + \fr 6:7 \ft A \fq denarius \ft was a day’s wage for a laborer\f* worth of bread would not be enough for each of them to get a little.”
\v 8 One of his disciples, \x + \xo 6:8 \xt ch. 1:40, 44\x*Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him,
\v 9 “There is a boy here who has five \x + \xo 6:9 \xt 2 Kgs. 4:42, 43\x*barley loaves and two fish, but \x + \xo 6:9 \xt 2 Kgs. 4:42, 43\x*what are they for so many?”
\v 10 Jesus said, \wj “Have the people sit down.”\wj* \x + \xo 6:10 \xt [Mark 6:39]\x*Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, about five thousand in number.
\v 11 Jesus then took the loaves, and \x + \xo 6:11 \xt ver. 23; See Matt. 15:36\x*when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, \wj “Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost.”\wj*
\v 13 So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
\v 14 When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, \x + \xo 6:14 \xt See ch. 4:19 \x*“This is indeed \x + \xo 6:14 \xt ch. 1:21; 7:40; See Matt. 21:11 \x*the Prophet \x + \xo 6:14 \xt ch. 11:27; See Matt. 11:3\x*who is to come into the world!”
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 6:15 \xt [ch. 12:12-15] \x*Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus \x + \xo 6:15 \xt For ver. 15-21, see Matt. 14:22-33; Mark 6:45-51; [Matt. 8:18] \x*withdrew again to \x + \xo 6:15 \xt ver. 3\x*the mountain by himself.
\s1 Jesus Walks on Water
\p
\v 16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
\v 17 got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
\v 18 The sea became rough because a strong wind was blowing.
\v 19 When they had rowed about three or four miles,\f + \fr 6:19 \ft Greek \fq twenty-five or thirty \+tl stadia\+tl*; a \+tl stadion\+tl* was about 607 feet or 185 meters\f* they saw Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened.
\v 20 \x + \xo 6:20 \xt [Luke 24:38, 39]\x*But he said to them, \wj “It is I; do not be afraid.”\wj*
\v 21 Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.
\s1 I Am the Bread of Life
\p
\v 22 On the next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only \x + \xo 6:22 \xt ch. 21:8\x*one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.
\v 23 Other boats from Tiberias came near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord \x + \xo 6:23 \xt ver. 11\x*had given thanks.
\v 24 \x + \xo 6:24 \xt For ver. 24, 25, [Matt. 14:34-36; Mark 6:53-56] \x*So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and \x + \xo 6:24 \xt ver. 17, 59\x*went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.
\p
\v 25 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, \x + \xo 6:25 \xt See ch. 1:38\x*“Rabbi, when did you come here?”
\v 26 Jesus answered them, \wj “Truly, truly, I say to you, \wj*\x + \xo 6:26 \xt ver. 24 \x*\wj you are seeking me, not because you saw \wj*\x + \xo 6:26 \xt ver. 2\x*\wj signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 6:27 \xt Isa. 55:2 \x*\wj Do not work for the food that perishes, but for \wj*\x + \xo 6:27 \xt [ver. 35, 50, 51, 54, 58] \x*\wj the food that endures to eternal life, which \wj*\x + \xo 6:27 \xt See Dan. 7:13 \x*\wj the Son of Man will give to you.

\v 28 Then they said to him, “What must we do, to be doing \x + \xo 6:28 \xt 1 Cor. 15:58; Rev. 2:26\x*the works of God?”
\v 29 Jesus answered them, \wj “This is the work of God, \wj*\x + \xo 6:29 \xt 1 John 3:23 \x*\wj that you believe in him whom \wj*\x + \xo 6:29 \xt See ch. 3:17\x*\wj he has sent.”\wj*
\v 30 So they said to him, \x + \xo 6:30 \xt See Matt. 12:38\x*“Then what sign do you do, that we may see and believe you? What work do you perform?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31 \xt ver. 49, 58; Ex. 16:15; Num. 11:7-9 \x*Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, \x + \xo 6:31 \xt Cited from Neh. 9:15; [Ps. 78:24, 25; 105:40; 1 Cor. 10:3]\x*‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
\v 32 Jesus then said to them, \wj “Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.\wj*
\v 33 \wj For the bread of God is \wj*\x + \xo 6:33 \xt ver. 50\x*\wj he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”\wj*
\v 34 They said to him, \x + \xo 6:34 \xt See ch. 4:15, 33\x*“Sir, give us this bread always.”
\p
\v 35 Jesus said to them, \x + \xo 6:35 \xt ver. 41, 48, 51; [ver. 58] \x*\wj “I am the bread of life; \wj*\x + \xo 6:35 \xt ch. 4:14; 7:37; [ch. 5:40; Matt. 11:28; Rev. 7:16]\x*\wj whoever comes to me shall not hunger, and whoever believes in me shall never thirst.\wj*

\p
\v 41 So the Jews grumbled about him, because he said, \x + \xo 6:41 \xt ver. 33, 35, 38\x*\wj “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”\wj*
\v 42 They said, \x + \xo 6:42 \xt See Matt. 13:55 \x*“Is not this Jesus, \x + \xo 6:42 \xt See ch. 1:45 \x*the son of Joseph, whose father and mother \x + \xo 6:42 \xt ch. 7:27, 28\x*we know? How does he now say, \wj ‘I have come down from heaven’\wj*?”

\s1 Jesus at the Feast of Booths
\p
\v 1 After this Jesus went about in Galilee.

\v 3 \x + \xo 7:3 \xt ver. 5, 10; See Matt. 12:46\x*So his brothers\f + \fr 7:3 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 5, 10\f* said to him, “Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples also may see the works you are doing.
\v 4 For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, \x + \xo 7:4 \xt [ch. 14:22; 18:20]\x*show yourself to the world.”
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5 \xt [Matt. 13:57; Mark 3:21] \x*For not even \x + \xo 7:5 \xt ver. 3, 10\x*his brothers believed in him.

\v 9 After saying this, he remained in Galilee.
\p
\v 10 But after \x + \xo 7:10 \xt ver. 3, 5\x*his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11 \xt ver. 1 \x*The Jews \x + \xo 7:11 \xt ch. 11:56\x*were looking for him at the feast, and saying, “Where is he?”

\v 13 Yet \x + \xo 7:13 \xt ch. 19:38; 20:19; [ch. 9:22; 12:42]\x*for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.
\p
\v 14 About the middle of the feast Jesus went up \x + \xo 7:14 \xt ver. 28\x*into the temple and began teaching.
\v 15 The Jews therefore \x + \xo 7:15 \xt [ver. 46; Luke 2:47; 4:22; Acts 4:13]\x*marveled, saying, “How is it that this man has learning,\f + \fr 7:15 \ft Or \fq this man knows his letters\f* when he has never studied?”
\v 16 So Jesus answered them, \x + \xo 7:16 \xt ch. 8:28; 12:49; 14:10, 24; [ch. 3:34] \x*\wj “My teaching is not mine, but his \wj*\x + \xo 7:16 \xt See ch. 3:17\x*\wj who sent me.\wj*

\v 18 \wj The one who speaks on his own authority \wj*\x + \xo 7:18 \xt ch. 5:41; 8:50\x*\wj seeks his own glory; but the one who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.\wj*

\v 20 The crowd answered, \x + \xo 7:20 \xt ch. 8:48, 52; 10:20; [Matt. 11:18; Mark 3:22; Luke 7:33]\x*“You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?”
\v 21 Jesus answered them, \wj “I did \wj*\x + \xo 7:21 \xt ver. 23; ch. 5:2-9\x*\wj one work, and you all marvel at it.\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22 \xt Lev. 12:3 \x*\wj Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but \wj*\x + \xo 7:22 \xt Gen. 17:10\x*\wj from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.\wj*

\s1 Can This Be the Christ?
\p
\v 25 Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, “Is not this the man whom \x + \xo 7:25 \xt ver. 1\x*they seek to kill?
\v 26 And here he is, \x + \xo 7:26 \xt ch. 18:20 \x*speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that \x + \xo 7:26 \xt ver. 48\x*the authorities really know that this is the Christ?

\v 28 So Jesus proclaimed, \x + \xo 7:28 \xt ver. 14 \x*as he taught in the temple, \x + \xo 7:28 \xt [See ver. 27 above] \x*\wj “You know me, and you know where I come from.

\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30 \xt ver. 44; ch. 10:39; [Matt. 21:46] \x*So they were seeking to arrest him, but \x + \xo 7:30 \xt ch. 8:20 \x*no one laid a hand on him, \x + \xo 7:30 \xt ver. 6\x*because his hour had not yet come.

\s1 Officers Sent to Arrest Jesus
\p
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd \x + \xo 7:32 \xt ver. 12 \x*muttering these things about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent \x + \xo 7:32 \xt ver. 45, 46\x*officers to arrest him.
\v 33 Jesus then said, \x + \xo 7:33 \xt ch. 12:35; 13:33; 14:19; 16:16-19 \x*\wj “I will be with you a little longer, and then \wj*\x + \xo 7:33 \xt ch. 16:5\x*\wj I am going to him who sent me.\wj*

\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37 \xt Lev. 23:36; Num. 29:35; Neh. 8:18 \x*On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and cried out, \x + \xo 7:37 \xt Isa. 55:1; See ch. 4:14 \x*\wj “If anyone thirsts, let him \wj*\x + \xo 7:37 \xt See ch. 6:35\x*\wj come to me and drink.\wj*

\v 39 Now \x + \xo 7:39 \xt Isa. 44:3; [1 Cor. 12:13; Gal. 3:14] \x*this he said about the Spirit, \x + \xo 7:39 \xt Joel 2:28; Acts 2:16-18; [ch. 1:33; 20:22; Luke 24:49] \x*whom those who believed in him were to receive, \x + \xo 7:39 \xt Acts 2:4, 33 \x*for as yet the Spirit had not been \x + \xo 7:39 \xt ch. 3:34; Luke 11:13 \x*given, \x + \xo 7:39 \xt ch. 14:16, 17; 16:7\x*because Jesus was not yet glorified.

\p
\v 40 When they heard these words, \x + \xo 7:40 \xt See ver. 31 \x*some of the people said, “This really is \x + \xo 7:40 \xt ch. 1:21; 6:14; See Matt. 21:11\x*the Prophet.”

\s1 Before Abraham Was, I Am
\p
\v 48 The Jews answered him, “Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and \x + \xo 8:48 \xt See ch. 7:20\x*have a demon?”
\v 49 Jesus answered, \wj “I do not have a demon, but \wj*\x + \xo 8:49 \xt ch. 5:23; [ch. 7:18]\x*\wj I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.\wj*

\v 52 The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon! \x + \xo 8:52 \xt [Zech. 1:5] \x*Abraham died, as did the prophets, yet \x + \xo 8:52 \xt ver. 51 \x*you say, \wj ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will never \wj*\x + \xo 8:52 \xt Matt. 16:28; Heb. 2:9\x*\wj taste death.’\wj*

\s1 Jesus Heals a Man Born Blind
\p
\v 1 As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, \x + \xo 9:2 \xt See ch. 1:38 \x*“Rabbi, \x + \xo 9:2 \xt [Luke 13:2, 4] \x*who sinned, \x + \xo 9:2 \xt [ver. 34] \x*this man or \x + \xo 9:2 \xt Ex. 20:5\x*his parents, that he was born blind?”
\v 3 Jesus answered, \wj “It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but \wj*\x + \xo 9:3 \xt [ch. 11:4]\x*\wj that the works of God might be displayed in him.\wj*
\v 4 \wj We must \wj*\x + \xo 9:4 \xt See ch. 4:34 \x*\wj work the works of him who sent me \wj*\x + \xo 9:4 \xt ch. 11:9; 12:35; [Rom. 13:12; Gal. 6:10]\x*\wj while it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.\wj*
\v 5 \wj As long as I am in the world, \wj*\x + \xo 9:5 \xt See ch. 1:4, 5, 9; 8:12\x*\wj I am the light of the world.”\wj*
\v 6 Having said these things, \x + \xo 9:6 \xt Mark 7:33; 8:23 \x*he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. \x + \xo 9:6 \xt See Matt. 9:29\x*Then he anointed the man’s eyes with the mud
\v 7 and said to him, \wj “Go, wash in \wj*\x + \xo 9:7 \xt Luke 13:4 \x*\wj the pool of Siloam”\wj* (which means Sent). So he went and washed and \x + \xo 9:7 \xt ch. 11:37\x*came back seeing.
\p
\v 8 The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar were saying, \x + \xo 9:8 \xt [Acts 3:2, 10]\x*“Is this not the man who used to sit and beg?”
\v 9 Some said, “It is he.” Others said, “No, but he is like him.” He kept saying, “I am the man.”
\v 10 So they said to him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”
\v 11 He answered, \x + \xo 9:11 \xt ver. 6, 7\x*“The man called Jesus made mud and anointed my eyes and said to me, \wj ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’\wj* So I went and washed and received my sight.”
\v 12 They said to him, “Where is he?” He said, “I do not know.”
\p
\v 13 They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.
\v 14 \x + \xo 9:14 \xt ch. 5:9\x*Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.
\v 15 \x + \xo 9:15 \xt ver. 10\x*So the Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”
\v 16 Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not \x + \xo 9:16 \xt See ch. 7:29 \x*from God, \x + \xo 9:16 \xt See Matt. 12:2 \x*for he does not keep the Sabbath.” But others said, \x + \xo 9:16 \xt ver. 33 \x*“How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?” And \x + \xo 9:16 \xt ch. 7:43; 10:19\x*there was a division among them.
\v 17 So they said again to the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?” He said, \x + \xo 9:17 \xt See ch. 4:19; 6:14\x*“He is a prophet.”
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 9:18 \xt ver. 22; [ver. 13]\x*The Jews\f + \fr 9:18 \ft Greek \+tl Ioudaioi\+tl* probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time; also verse 22\f* did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight
\v 19 and asked them, “Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
\v 20 His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
\v 21 But how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age. He will speak for himself.”
\v 22 (His parents said these things \x + \xo 9:22 \xt See ch. 7:13 \x*because they feared the Jews, for \x + \xo 9:22 \xt [ch. 7:45-52] \x*the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should \x + \xo 9:22 \xt [Rom. 10:9] \x*confess Jesus\f + \fr 9:22 \ft Greek \fq him\f* to be Christ, \x + \xo 9:22 \xt ch. 12:42; 16:2\x*he was to be put out of the synagogue.)
\v 23 Therefore his parents said, \x + \xo 9:23 \xt ver. 21\x*“He is of age; ask him.”
\p
\v 24 So for the second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, \x + \xo 9:24 \xt Josh. 7:19; Jer. 13:16; [1 Sam. 6:5; Isa. 42:12; Acts 12:23] \x*“Give glory to God. We know that \x + \xo 9:24 \xt ver. 16\x*this man is a sinner.”
\v 25 He answered, “Whether he is a sinner I do not know. One thing I do know, that though I \x + \xo 9:25 \xt ver. 18, 24\x*was blind, now I see.”
\v 26 They said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
\v 27 He answered them, \x + \xo 9:27 \xt ver. 15\x*“I have told you already, and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also want to become his disciples?”
\v 28 And they reviled him, saying, “You are his disciple, but \x + \xo 9:28 \xt [ch. 5:45]\x*we are disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this man, \x + \xo 9:29 \xt See ch. 8:14\x*we do not know where he comes from.”
\v 30 The man answered, “Why, this is \x + \xo 9:30 \xt [ch. 12:37] \x*an amazing thing! \x + \xo 9:30 \xt [ch. 3:10]\x*You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.
\v 31 We know that \x + \xo 9:31 \xt Job 27:9; Ps. 66:18; Prov. 28:9 \x*God does not listen to sinners, but \x + \xo 9:31 \xt Ps. 34:15, 16; 145:19; Prov. 15:20; [James 5:16]\x*if anyone is a worshiper of God and does his will, God listens to him.
\v 32 Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.
\v 33 \x + \xo 9:33 \xt ver. 16; [ch. 1:21; 3:2]\x*If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
\v 34 They answered him, \x + \xo 9:34 \xt [ver. 2] \x*“You were born in utter sin, and would you teach us?” And they \x + \xo 9:34 \xt [ver. 22]\x*cast him out.
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him he said, \wj “Do you believe in \wj*\x + \xo 9:35 \xt ch. 10:36\x*\wj the Son of Man?”\wj*\f + \fr 9:35 \ft Some manuscripts \fq the Son of God\f*
\v 36 He answered, \x + \xo 9:36 \xt [Rom. 10:14]\x*“And who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?”
\v 37 Jesus said to him, \wj “You have seen him, and \wj*\x + \xo 9:37 \xt ch. 4:26\x*\wj it is he who is speaking to you.”\wj*
\v 38 He said, “Lord, I believe,” and he worshiped him.
\v 39 Jesus said, \x + \xo 9:39 \xt See ch. 5:22 \x*\wj “For judgment I came into this world, \wj*\x + \xo 9:39 \xt [Matt. 11:25; Luke 4:18] \x*\wj that those who do not see may see, and \wj*\x + \xo 9:39 \xt [Matt. 9:13; 13:13; Mark 4:12; 2 Cor. 2:16]\x*\wj those who see may become blind.”\wj*
\v 40 Some of the Pharisees near him heard these things, and said to him, \x + \xo 9:40 \xt Rom. 2:19\x*“Are we also blind?”
\v 41 Jesus said to them, \wj “If you were blind, \wj*\x + \xo 9:41 \xt ch. 15:22, 24; [ch. 19:11; 1 John 1:8]\x*\wj you would have no guilt;\wj*\f + \fr 9:41 \ft Greek \fq you would not have sin\f*\wj but now that you say, ‘We see,’ your guilt remains.\wj*

\v 19 \x + \xo 10:19 \xt ch. 7:43; 9:16\x*There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.
\v 20 Many of them said, \x + \xo 10:20 \xt See ch. 7:20 \x*“He has a demon, and \x + \xo 10:20 \xt [Mark 3:21]\x*is insane; why listen to him?”
\v 21 Others said, “These are not the words of one who is oppressed by a demon. \x + \xo 10:21 \xt [Ex. 4:11; Ps. 146:8]; See ch. 9:33\x*Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
\s1 I and the Father Are One
\p
\v 22 At that time the Feast of Dedication took place at Jerusalem. It was winter,
\v 23 and Jesus was walking in the temple, \x + \xo 10:23 \xt Acts 3:11; 5:12\x*in the colonnade of Solomon.
\v 24 So the Jews gathered around him and said to him, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are \x + \xo 10:24 \xt ch. 1:41 \x*the Christ, \x + \xo 10:24 \xt Matt. 26:63; Luke 22:67\x*tell us plainly.”
\v 25 Jesus answered them, \wj “I told you, and you do not believe. \wj*\x + \xo 10:25 \xt ver. 38; See ch. 5:36 \x*\wj The works that I do \wj*\x + \xo 10:25 \xt See ch. 5:43\x*\wj in my Father’s name bear witness about me,\wj*

\v 30 \x + \xo 10:30 \xt ch. 17:11, 22; [ch. 5:19; 14:9]\x*\wj I and the Father are one.”\wj*
\p
\v 31 \x + \xo 10:31 \xt ch. 8:59\x*The Jews picked up stones again to stone him.
\v 32 Jesus answered them, \wj “I have shown you many good works from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?”\wj*
\v 33 The Jews answered him, “It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but \x + \xo 10:33 \xt See Lev. 24:16; Matt. 9:3 \x*for blasphemy, because you, being a man, \x + \xo 10:33 \xt ch. 5:18\x*make yourself God.”
\v 34 Jesus answered them, \wj “Is it not written in \wj*\x + \xo 10:34 \xt [ch. 12:34; 15:25; 1 Cor. 14:21] \x*\wj your Law, \wj*\x + \xo 10:34 \xt Cited from Ps. 82:6\x*\wj ‘I said, you are gods’?\wj*
\v 35 \wj If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be \wj*\x + \xo 10:35 \xt [Matt. 5:17, 19]\x*\wj broken—\wj*

\v 39 \x + \xo 10:39 \xt ch. 7:30, 44\x*Again they sought to arrest him, but he escaped from their hands.
\p
\v 40 He went away again across the Jordan to the place \x + \xo 10:40 \xt ch. 1:28\x*where John had been baptizing at first, and there he remained.
\v 41 And many came to him. And they said, “John did no sign, but \x + \xo 10:41 \xt ch. 1:7, 29-34; 3:27-30; 5:33\x*everything that John said about this man was true.”
\v 42 And \x + \xo 10:42 \xt See ch. 7:31\x*many believed in him there.
\c 11
\s1 The Death of Lazarus
\p
\v 1 Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of \x + \xo 11:1 \xt See Luke 10:38, 39\x*Mary and her sister Martha.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2 \xt ch. 12:3\x*It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.
\v 3 So the sisters sent to him, saying, “Lord, \x + \xo 11:3 \xt ver. 5, 11, 36\x*he whom you love is ill.”
\v 4 But when Jesus heard it he said, \x + \xo 11:4 \xt [ver. 11; Matt. 9:24] \x*\wj “This illness does not lead to death. It is for \wj*\x + \xo 11:4 \xt ver. 40; [ch. 9:3; 13:31]\x*\wj the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”\wj*
\p
\v 5 Now \x + \xo 11:5 \xt ver. 3\x*Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
\v 6 So, when he heard that Lazarus\f + \fr 11:6 \ft Greek \fq he\ft ; also verse 17\f* was ill, \x + \xo 11:6 \xt [ch. 2:4; 7:6, 8]\x*he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.
\v 7 Then after this he said to the disciples, \x + \xo 11:7 \xt ch. 10:40\x*\wj “Let us go to Judea again.”\wj*
\v 8 The disciples said to him, \x + \xo 11:8 \xt See ch. 1:38 \x*“Rabbi, \x + \xo 11:8 \xt ch. 8:59; 10:31\x*the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?”
\v 9 Jesus answered, \x + \xo 11:9 \xt [Luke 13:33] \x*\wj “Are there not twelve hours in the day? \wj*\x + \xo 11:9 \xt See ch. 9:4; 1 John 2:10\x*\wj If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.\wj*
\v 10 \wj But \wj*\x + \xo 11:10 \xt Jer. 13:16\x*\wj if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not \wj*\x + \xo 11:10 \xt Jer. 13:16\x*\wj in him.”\wj*
\v 11 After saying these things, he said to them, \wj “Our friend Lazarus \wj*\x + \xo 11:11 \xt See Matt. 27:52\x*\wj has fallen asleep, but I go to awaken him.”\wj*
\v 12 The disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
\v 13 Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.
\v 14 Then Jesus told them plainly, \wj “Lazarus has died,\wj*
\v 15 \wj and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”\wj*
\v 16 \x + \xo 11:16 \xt ch. 14:5; 20:24, 26-28; 21:2; Matt. 10:3; Mark 3:18; Luke 6:15; Acts 1:13 \x*So Thomas, called the Twin,\f + \fr 11:16 \ft Greek \+tl Didymus\+tl*\f* said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, \x + \xo 11:16 \xt [ch. 13:37]\x*that we may die with him.”
\s1 I Am the Resurrection and the Life
\p
\v 17 Now when Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb \x + \xo 11:17 \xt ver. 39\x*four days.
\v 18 Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles\f + \fr 11:18 \ft Greek \fq fifteen \+tl stadia\+tl*; a \+tl stadion\+tl* was about 607 feet or 185 meters\f* off,
\v 19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary \x + \xo 11:19 \xt ver. 31; Job 2:11\x*to console them concerning their brother.
\v 20 \x + \xo 11:20 \xt [Luke 10:38, 39]\x*So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary remained seated in the house.
\v 21 Martha said to \x + \xo 11:21 \xt ver. 32 \x*Jesus, “Lord, \x + \xo 11:21 \xt [ver. 37]\x*if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
\v 22 But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, \x + \xo 11:22 \xt [ver. 42; ch. 9:31]\x*God will give you.”
\v 23 Jesus said to her, \wj “Your brother will rise again.”\wj*
\v 24 \x + \xo 11:24 \xt [ver. 39] \x*Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in \x + \xo 11:24 \xt ch. 5:29; Luke 14:14; See ch. 6:39\x*the resurrection on the last day.”
\v 25 Jesus said to her, \x + \xo 11:25 \xt [ch. 5:21; 6:40, 44; 1 Cor. 15:21] \x*\wj “I am the resurrection and \wj*\x + \xo 11:25 \xt ch. 14:6; [ch. 6:57; Col. 3:4]; See ch. 1:4 \x*\wj the life.\wj*\f + \fr 11:25 \ft Some manuscripts omit \fq and the life\f*\wj Whoever believes in me, \wj*\x + \xo 11:25 \xt [ch. 12:25] \x*\wj though he die, \wj*\x + \xo 11:25 \xt See ch. 3:36\x*\wj yet shall he live,\wj*
\v 26 \wj and everyone who lives and believes in me \wj*\x + \xo 11:26 \xt ch. 6:50, 51; 8:51\x*\wj shall never die. Do you believe this?”\wj*
\v 27 She said to him, “Yes, Lord; \x + \xo 11:27 \xt ch. 6:69; 20:31; 1 John 5:1, 5; [ch. 8:24; 13:19; 1 John 4:16] \x*I believe that \x + \xo 11:27 \xt Matt. 16:16 \x*you are the Christ, the Son of God, \x + \xo 11:27 \xt ch. 6:14; See Matt. 11:3\x*who is coming into the world.”
\s1 Jesus Weeps
\p
\v 28 When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying in private, \x + \xo 11:28 \xt Matt. 26:18; Mark 14:14; Luke 22:11; See ch. 13:13\x*“The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”
\v 29 And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.
\v 30 Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.
\v 31 When the Jews \x + \xo 11:31 \xt ver. 19\x*who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.
\v 32 Now when Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet, saying to him, \x + \xo 11:32 \xt ver. 21\x*“Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
\v 33 When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come with her also weeping, he \x + \xo 11:33 \xt ver. 38; Mark 14:5 (Gk.) \x*was deeply moved\f + \fr 11:33 \ft Or \fq was indignant\ft ; also verse 38\f* in his spirit and \x + \xo 11:33 \xt ch. 12:27; 13:21\x*greatly troubled.
\v 34 And he said, \wj “Where have you laid him?”\wj* They said to him, “Lord, come and see.”
\v 35 \x + \xo 11:35 \xt [Luke 19:41]\x*Jesus wept.
\v 36 So the Jews said, “See \x + \xo 11:36 \xt ver. 3\x*how he loved him!”
\v 37 But some of them said, “Could not he \x + \xo 11:37 \xt ch. 9:6, 7 \x*who opened the eyes of the blind man \x + \xo 11:37 \xt [ver. 21, 32]\x*also have kept this man from dying?”
\s1 Jesus Raises Lazarus
\p
\v 38 Then Jesus, \x + \xo 11:38 \xt ver. 33 \x*deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was \x + \xo 11:38 \xt Isa. 22:16 \x*a cave, and \x + \xo 11:38 \xt ch. 20:1; Matt. 27:60; Mark 15:46; Luke 24:2\x*a stone lay against it.
\v 39 Jesus said, \wj “Take away the stone.”\wj* Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, “Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for \x + \xo 11:39 \xt ver. 17\x*he has been dead four days.”
\v 40 Jesus said to her, \x + \xo 11:40 \xt ver. 25, 26 \x*\wj “Did I not tell you that if you believed you would see \wj*\x + \xo 11:40 \xt ver. 4; [Rom. 6:4]\x*\wj the glory of God?”\wj*
\v 41 So they took away the stone. And Jesus \x + \xo 11:41 \xt ch. 17:1\x*lifted up his eyes and said, \wj “Father, I thank you that you have heard me.\wj*
\v 42 \x + \xo 11:42 \xt [ver. 22; Matt. 26:53] \x*\wj I knew that you always hear me, but I said this \wj*\x + \xo 11:42 \xt ch. 12:29, 30 \x*\wj on account of the people standing around, \wj*\x + \xo 11:42 \xt ch. 17:8, 21; See ch. 3:17\x*\wj that they may believe that you sent me.”\wj*
\v 43 When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, \wj “Lazarus, come out.”\wj*
\v 44 \x + \xo 11:44 \xt ch. 5:28, 29 \x*The man who had died came out, \x + \xo 11:44 \xt ch. 19:40 \x*his hands and feet bound with linen strips, and \x + \xo 11:44 \xt [ch. 20:7]\x*his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, \wj “Unbind him, and let him go.”\wj*
\s1 The Plot to Kill Jesus
\p
\v 45 \x + \xo 11:45 \xt ch. 12:11; [Acts 9:42] \x*Many of the Jews therefore, \x + \xo 11:45 \xt ver. 19 \x*who had come with Mary and \x + \xo 11:45 \xt ch. 2:23\x*had seen what he did, believed in him,
\v 46 but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
\v 47 So the chief priests and the Pharisees \x + \xo 11:47 \xt See Matt. 26:3 \x*gathered \x + \xo 11:47 \xt See Matt. 5:22 \x*the council and said, \x + \xo 11:47 \xt ch. 12:19; [Acts 4:16]\x*“What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.
\v 48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and \x + \xo 11:48 \xt [ch. 6:15; 18:36, 37] \x*the Romans will come and take away both our \x + \xo 11:48 \xt Acts 21:28\x*place and our nation.”
\v 49 But one of them, \x + \xo 11:49 \xt See Matt. 26:3 \x*Caiaphas, \x + \xo 11:49 \xt ver. 51; ch. 18:13\x*who was high priest that year, said to them, “You know nothing at all.
\v 50 Nor do you understand that \x + \xo 11:50 \xt ch. 18:14\x*it is better for you that one man should die for the people, not that the whole nation should perish.”
\v 51 He did not say this of his own accord, but \x + \xo 11:51 \xt ver. 49 \x*being high priest that year \x + \xo 11:51 \xt [Ex. 28:30; Num. 27:21; 1 Sam. 23:9; 30:7; Ezra 2:63; Neh. 7:65]\x*he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
\v 52 and \x + \xo 11:52 \xt Isa. 49:6; 1 John 2:2 \x*not for the nation only, but also \x + \xo 11:52 \xt See ch. 10:16\x*to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
\v 53 So from that day on they \x + \xo 11:53 \xt See ch. 7:1\x*made plans to put him to death.
\p
\v 54 Jesus therefore \x + \xo 11:54 \xt ch. 7:1, 4\x*no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and there he stayed with the disciples.
\p
\v 55 Now \x + \xo 11:55 \xt See ch. 6:4 \x*the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and \x + \xo 11:55 \xt Luke 2:42 \x*many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover \x + \xo 11:55 \xt 2 Chr. 30:17, 18; [ch. 18:28; Acts 21:24]\x*to purify themselves.
\v 56 \x + \xo 11:56 \xt See ch. 7:11\x*They were looking for\f + \fr 11:56 \ft Greek \fq were seeking for\f* Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, “What do you think? That he will not come to the feast at all?”
\v 57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him.
\c 12
\s1 Mary Anoints Jesus at Bethany
\p
\v 1 Six days before \x + \xo 12:1 \xt ver. 12, 20; ch. 11:55 \x*the Passover, \x + \xo 12:1 \xt For ver. 1-8, see Matt. 26:6-11; Mark 14:3-8 \x*Jesus therefore came to Bethany, \x + \xo 12:1 \xt ch. 11:1\x*where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they gave a dinner for him there. \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Luke 10:38, 40\x*Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those reclining with him at table.
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3 \xt [Luke 7:37, 38]\x*Mary therefore took a pound\f + \fr 12:3 \ft Greek \+tl litra\+tl*; a \+tl litra\+tl* (or Roman pound) was equal to about 11 1/2 ounces or 327 grams\f* of expensive ointment made from pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.
\v 4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was about to betray him), said,
\v 5 “Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii\f + \fr 12:5 \ft A \fq denarius \ft was a day’s wage for a laborer\f* and \x + \xo 12:5 \xt ch. 13:29\x*given to the poor?”
\v 6 He said this, not because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief, and \x + \xo 12:6 \xt [See ver. 5 above]\x*having charge of the moneybag he used to help himself to what was put into it.
\v 7 Jesus said, \wj “Leave her alone, so that she may keep it\wj*\f + \fr 12:7 \ft Or \fq Leave her alone; she intended to keep it\f*\wj for the day of my burial.\wj*
\v 8 \wj For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.”\wj*
\s1 The Plot to Kill Lazarus
\p
\v 9 When the large crowd of the Jews learned that Jesus\f + \fr 12:9 \ft Greek \fq he\f* was there, they came, not only on account of him but also to see Lazarus, \x + \xo 12:9 \xt ch. 11:44\x*whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 \x + \xo 12:10 \xt [Luke 16:31]\x*So the chief priests made plans to put Lazarus to death as well,
\v 11 because \x + \xo 12:11 \xt ver. 18; ch. 11:45\x*on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.
\s1 The Triumphal Entry
\p
\v 12 The next day \x + \xo 12:12 \xt For ver. 12-15, see Matt. 21:4-9; Mark 11:7-10; Luke 19:35-38\x*the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.
\v 13 So they took branches of \x + \xo 12:13 \xt [Rev. 7:9] \x*palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, \x + \xo 12:13 \xt Ps. 118:25, 26 \x*“Hosanna! Blessed is \x + \xo 12:13 \xt [ch. 5:43] \x*he who comes in the name of the Lord, even \x + \xo 12:13 \xt See ch. 1:49\x*the King of Israel!”
\v 14 And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written,

\v 15 \x + \xo 12:15 \xt Cited from Zech. 9:9\x*“Fear not, daughter of Zion;
\q1 behold, your king is coming,

\b
\m
\v 16 \x + \xo 12:16 \xt [ch. 13:7]; See Mark 9:32 \x*His disciples did not understand these things at first, but \x + \xo 12:16 \xt ver. 23; See ch. 7:39 \x*when Jesus was glorified, then \x + \xo 12:16 \xt ch. 2:22\x*they remembered that these things had been written about him and had been done to him.
\v 17 \x + \xo 12:17 \xt [Luke 19:37]\x*The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to bear witness.
\v 18 The reason why the crowd went to meet him \x + \xo 12:18 \xt ver. 9-11\x*was that they heard he had done this sign.
\v 19 So the Pharisees said to one another, \x + \xo 12:19 \xt ch. 11:47 \x*“You see that you are gaining nothing. Look, \x + \xo 12:19 \xt [ch. 3:26]\x*the world has gone after him.”

\p
\v 20 Now \x + \xo 12:20 \xt [1 Kgs. 8:41-43; Acts 8:27] \x*among those who went up to worship at the feast were some \x + \xo 12:20 \xt Acts 17:4; [Mark 7:26]; See ch. 7:35\x*Greeks.
\v 21 So these came to \x + \xo 12:21 \xt ch. 1:44\x*Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, “Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”

\v 29 The crowd that stood there and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, \x + \xo 12:29 \xt Acts 23:9\x*“An angel has spoken to him.”

\v 33 He said this \x + \xo 12:33 \xt ch. 18:32\x*to show by what kind of death he was going to die.

\v 37 Though he had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him,

\v 39 Therefore they \x + \xo 12:39 \xt [ch. 5:44]\x*could not believe. For again Isaiah said,

\v 41 Isaiah said these things because \x + \xo 12:41 \xt Isa. 6:1 \x*he saw his glory and \x + \xo 12:41 \xt [ch. 5:46]\x*spoke of him.
\v 42 Nevertheless, \x + \xo 12:42 \xt ch. 3:1; [ch. 7:48] \x*many even of the authorities believed in him, but \x + \xo 12:42 \xt See ch. 7:13 \x*for fear of the Pharisees they did not \x + \xo 12:42 \xt See ch. 9:22\x*confess it, so that they would not be \x + \xo 12:42 \xt See ch. 9:22\x*put out of the synagogue;

\v 5 Then he \x + \xo 13:5 \xt [2 Kgs. 3:11]\x*poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
\v 6 He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”

\p
\v 21 After saying these things, \x + \xo 13:21 \xt ch. 12:27 \x*Jesus was troubled in his spirit, and testified, \x + \xo 13:21 \xt Matt. 26:21; Mark 14:18; Luke 22:21 \x*\wj “Truly, truly, I say to you, \wj*\x + \xo 13:21 \xt Acts 1:17\x*\wj one of you will betray me.”\wj*

\v 28 Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.

\v 4 Then Jesus, \x + \xo 18:4 \xt ch. 13:1 \x*knowing all that would happen to him, came forward and said to them, \x + \xo 18:4 \xt ver. 7; ch. 1:38; 20:15\x*\wj “Whom do you seek?”\wj*

\v 9 \x + \xo 18:9 \xt ch. 17:12\x*This was to fulfill the word that he had spoken: \wj “Of those whom you gave me I have lost not one.”\wj*

\v 17 \x + \xo 18:17 \xt Acts 12:13\x*The servant girl at the door said to Peter, “You also are not one of this man’s disciples, are you?” He said, “I am not.”

\v 21 \wj Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me what I said to them; they know what I said.”\wj*
\v 22 When he had said these things, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, \x + \xo 18:22 \xt [Acts 23:4]\x*“Is that how you answer the high priest?”
\v 23 Jesus answered him, \wj “If what I said is wrong, bear witness about the wrong; but if what I said is right, why do you strike me?”\wj*

\v 26 One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of \x + \xo 18:26 \xt ver. 10 \x*the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Did I not see you \x + \xo 18:26 \xt ver. 1\x*in the garden with him?”

\v 35 Pilate answered, “Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have delivered you over to me. What have you done?”
\v 36 Jesus answered, \x + \xo 18:36 \xt [ch. 6:15; Dan. 2:44; 7:14, 27; Luke 17:21] \x*\wj “My kingdom \wj*\x + \xo 18:36 \xt ch. 8:23; [ch. 15:19; 17:14, 16; 1 John 2:16; 4:5] \x*\wj is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, \wj*\x + \xo 18:36 \xt [Matt. 26:53] \x*\wj my servants would have been fighting, that \wj*\x + \xo 18:36 \xt ch. 19:16\x*\wj I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.”\wj*
\v 37 Then Pilate said to him, “So you are a king?” Jesus answered, \x + \xo 18:37 \xt See Luke 22:70 \x*\wj “You say that I am a king. \wj*\x + \xo 18:37 \xt [ch. 12:27; Rom. 14:9] \x*\wj For this purpose I was born and for this purpose \wj*\x + \xo 18:37 \xt ch. 16:28 \x*\wj I have come into the world—\wj*\x + \xo 18:37 \xt ch. 3:11, 32; 5:31; 8:13, 14, 18 \x*\wj to bear witness to the truth. \wj*\x + \xo 18:37 \xt 1 John 4:6; [ch. 8:47] \x*\wj Everyone who is \wj*\x + \xo 18:37 \xt 1 John 2:21; 3:19 \x*\wj of the truth \wj*\x + \xo 18:37 \xt ch. 10:16, 27\x*\wj listens to my voice.”\wj*
\v 38 Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”
\p After he had said this, \x + \xo 18:38 \xt ch. 19:4 \x*he went back outside to the Jews and told them, \x + \xo 18:38 \xt ch. 19:4, 6; See Luke 23:4\x*“I find no guilt in him.
\v 39 \x + \xo 18:39 \xt For ver. 39, 40, see Matt. 27:15-18, 20-23; Mark 15:6-14; Luke 23:18-23\x*But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
\v 40 They cried out again, \x + \xo 18:40 \xt Acts 3:14\x*“Not this man, but Barabbas!” Now Barabbas was a robber.\f + \fr 18:40 \ft Or \fq an insurrectionist\f*
\c 19
\s1 Jesus Delivered to Be Crucified
\p
\v 1 Then Pilate took Jesus and \x + \xo 19:1 \xt Matt. 20:19; 27:26; Mark 15:15; Luke 23:16\x*flogged him.
\v 2 \x + \xo 19:2 \xt Matt. 27:27-30; Mark 15:16-19\x*And the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head and arrayed him in a purple robe.
\v 3 They came up to him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and struck him with their hands.
\v 4 Pilate went out again and said to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you that you may know that \x + \xo 19:4 \xt ver. 6; ch. 18:38\x*I find no guilt in him.”
\v 5 So Jesus came out, wearing \x + \xo 19:5 \xt ver. 2 \x*the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, \x + \xo 19:5 \xt [ver. 14]\x*“Behold the man!”
\v 6 When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, \x + \xo 19:6 \xt [ch. 18:31] \x*“Take him yourselves and crucify him, for \x + \xo 19:6 \xt ver. 4\x*I find no guilt in him.”
\v 7 The Jews\f + \fr 19:7 \ft Greek \+tl Ioudaioi\+tl* probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time; also verses 12, 14, 31, 38\f* answered him, “We have a law, and \x + \xo 19:7 \xt Lev. 24:16; [ch. 10:33] \x*according to that law he ought to die because \x + \xo 19:7 \xt ch. 5:17, 18; 10:36; Matt. 26:63; Luke 22:70\x*he has made himself the Son of God.”
\v 8 When Pilate heard this statement, \x + \xo 19:8 \xt [Matt. 27:19]\x*he was even more afraid.
\v 9 \x + \xo 19:9 \xt ch. 18:33 \x*He entered his headquarters again and said to Jesus, \x + \xo 19:9 \xt ch. 7:27 \x*“Where are you from?” But \x + \xo 19:9 \xt [ch. 18:37]; See Matt. 26:63\x*Jesus gave him no answer.
\v 10 So Pilate said to him, “You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you and authority to crucify you?”
\v 11 Jesus answered him, \x + \xo 19:11 \xt [Rom. 13:1] \x*\wj “You would have no authority over me at all unless it had been given you from above. Therefore \wj*\x + \xo 19:11 \xt [ch. 18:14, 28-32; Matt. 27:2] \x*\wj he who delivered me over to you \wj*\x + \xo 19:11 \xt See ch. 9:41\x*\wj has the greater sin.”\wj*
\p
\v 12 From then on \x + \xo 19:12 \xt Acts 3:13 \x*Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, “If you release this man, you are not Caesar’s friend. \x + \xo 19:12 \xt See Luke 23:2\x*Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.”
\v 13 So when Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on \x + \xo 19:13 \xt Matt. 27:19\x*the judgment seat at a place called The Stone Pavement, and in Aramaic\f + \fr 19:13 \ft Or \fq Hebrew\ft ; also verses 17, 20\f* Gabbatha.
\v 14 Now it was \x + \xo 19:14 \xt [ch. 18:28]; See Matt. 27:62 \x*the day of Preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour.\f + \fr 19:14 \ft That is, about noon\f* He said to the Jews, \x + \xo 19:14 \xt [ver. 5]\x*“Behold your King!”
\v 15 They cried out, \x + \xo 19:15 \xt Luke 23:18; [Acts 21:36]\x*“Away with him, away with him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your King?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but Caesar.”
\v 16 \x + \xo 19:16 \xt Matt. 27:26; Mark 15:15; Luke 23:25 \x*So he \x + \xo 19:16 \xt ch. 18:36-40\x*delivered him over to them to be crucified.
\s1 The Crucifixion
\p So they took Jesus,
\v 17 and \x + \xo 19:17 \xt Matt. 27:33; Mark 15:22; Luke 23:33 \x*he went out, \x + \xo 19:17 \xt Luke 14:27; [Matt. 27:32; Mark 15:21; Luke 23:26]\x*bearing his own cross, to the place called The Place of a Skull, which in Aramaic is called Golgotha.
\v 18 \x + \xo 19:18 \xt Matt. 27:38; Mark 15:24, 27; Luke 23:32, 33\x*There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.
\v 19 Pilate \x + \xo 19:19 \xt [Matt. 27:37; Mark 15:26; Luke 23:38]\x*also wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”
\v 20 Many of the Jews read this inscription, for \x + \xo 19:20 \xt ver. 17; [Num. 15:35, 36; Heb. 13:12]\x*the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Aramaic, in Latin, and in Greek.
\v 21 So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”
\v 22 Pilate answered, \x + \xo 19:22 \xt [Gen. 43:14; Esth. 4:16]\x*“What I have written I have written.”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 19:23 \xt Matt. 27:35; Mark 15:24; Luke 23:34\x*When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic.\f + \fr 19:23 \ft Greek \+tl chiton\+tl*, a long garment worn under the cloak next to the skin\f* But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom,
\v 24 so they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be.” \x + \xo 19:24 \xt See ch. 13:18 \x*This was to fulfill the Scripture which says,
\b
\q1 \x + \xo 19:24 \xt Cited from Ps. 22:18\x*“They divided my garments among them,
\q2 and for my clothing they cast lots.”
\b
\m So the soldiers did these things,
\v 25 \x + \xo 19:25 \xt Matt. 27:55, 56; Mark 15:40, 41; Luke 23:49\x*but standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 When Jesus saw his mother and \x + \xo 19:26 \xt See ch. 13:23 \x*the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, \x + \xo 19:26 \xt ch. 2:4\x*\wj “Woman, behold, your son!”\wj*
\v 27 Then he said to the disciple, \wj “Behold, your mother!”\wj* And from that hour the disciple took her to \x + \xo 19:27 \xt [ch. 16:32]\x*his own home.
\s1 The Death of Jesus
\p
\v 28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now \x + \xo 19:28 \xt [ver. 30] \x*finished, said (\x + \xo 19:28 \xt [See ver. 24 above] \x*to fulfill the Scripture), \x + \xo 19:28 \xt Ps. 69:21; See ch. 4:6, 7\x*\wj “I thirst.”\wj*
\v 29 A jar full of sour wine stood there, \x + \xo 19:29 \xt Matt. 27:48; Mark 15:36; [Luke 23:36]\x*so they put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop branch and held it to his mouth.
\v 30 When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, \x + \xo 19:30 \xt [ver. 28; Acts 13:29]; See ch. 17:4 \x*\wj “It is finished,”\wj* and he bowed his head and \x + \xo 19:30 \xt Matt. 27:50; Mark 15:37; Luke 23:46\x*gave up his spirit.
\s1 Jesus’ Side Is Pierced
\p
\v 31 Since it was \x + \xo 19:31 \xt ver. 14 \x*the day of Preparation, and \x + \xo 19:31 \xt Deut. 21:23; Josh. 8:29; 10:26, 27 \x*so that the bodies would not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was \x + \xo 19:31 \xt Ex. 12:16\x*a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
\v 32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other \x + \xo 19:32 \xt ver. 18\x*who had been crucified with him.
\v 33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
\v 34 But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out \x + \xo 19:34 \xt 1 John 5:6, 8\x*blood and water.
\v 35 \x + \xo 19:35 \xt 1 John 1:1-3; Rev. 1:2; See ch. 15:27 \x*He who saw it has borne witness—\x + \xo 19:35 \xt [ch. 21:24] \x*his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—\x + \xo 19:35 \xt [ch. 20:31]\x*that you also may believe.
\v 36 \x + \xo 19:36 \xt See Matt. 1:22 \x*For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: \x + \xo 19:36 \xt Cited from Ex. 12:46; Num. 9:12; [1 Cor. 5:7] \x*“Not one of his bones \x + \xo 19:36 \xt Ps. 34:20\x*will be broken.”
\v 37 And again another Scripture says, \x + \xo 19:37 \xt Cited from Zech. 12:10; [Rev. 1:7]\x*“They will look on him whom they have pierced.”
\s1 Jesus Is Buried
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 19:38 \xt For ver. 38-42, see Matt. 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56 \x*After these things Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly \x + \xo 19:38 \xt See ch. 7:13\x*for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.
\v 39 \x + \xo 19:39 \xt ch. 3:1, 2; 7:50 \x*Nicodemus also, who earlier had come to Jesus\f + \fr 19:39 \ft Greek \fq him\f* by night, came \x + \xo 19:39 \xt [Mark 16:1; Luke 24:1] \x*bringing a mixture of \x + \xo 19:39 \xt Ps. 45:8; Prov. 7:17; Song 4:14\x*myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds\f + \fr 19:39 \ft Greek \fq one hundred \+tl litras\+tl*; a \+tl litra\+tl* (or Roman pound) was equal to about 11 1/2 ounces or 327 grams\f* in weight.
\v 40 So they took the body of Jesus and \x + \xo 19:40 \xt ch. 11:44; [2 Chr. 16:14; Acts 5:6] \x*bound it in \x + \xo 19:40 \xt ch. 20:5-7; Luke 24:12\x*linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a \x + \xo 19:41 \xt [ch. 20:15] \x*garden, and \x + \xo 19:41 \xt 2 Kgs. 21:18, 26 \x*in the garden a new tomb \x + \xo 19:41 \xt Luke 23:53; [Mark 11:2]\x*in which no one had yet been laid.
\v 42 So because of the Jewish \x + \xo 19:42 \xt ver. 14, 31 \x*day of Preparation, \x + \xo 19:42 \xt ver. 41\x*since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.
\c 20
\s1 The Resurrection
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 20:1 \xt Matt. 28:1; Mark 16:1, 2; Luke 24:1 \x*Now on the first day of the week Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that \x + \xo 20:1 \xt Matt. 27:60, 66; 28:2; Mark 15:46; 16:3, 4; Luke 24:2\x*the stone had been taken away from the tomb.
\v 2 So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, \x + \xo 20:2 \xt See ch. 13:23 \x*the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and \x + \xo 20:2 \xt ver. 13\x*we do not know where they have laid him.”
\v 3 \x + \xo 20:3 \xt Luke 24:12\x*So Peter went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.
\v 4 Both of them were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
\v 5 And stooping to look in, he saw \x + \xo 20:5 \xt ch. 19:40\x*the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.
\v 6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen cloths lying there,
\v 7 and \x + \xo 20:7 \xt ch. 11:44\x*the face cloth, which had been on Jesus’\f + \fr 20:7 \ft Greek \fq his\f* head, not lying with the linen cloths but folded up in a place by itself.
\v 8 Then the other disciple, \x + \xo 20:8 \xt ver. 4\x*who had reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;
\v 9 for as yet \x + \xo 20:9 \xt Matt. 22:29 \x*they did not understand the Scripture, \x + \xo 20:9 \xt Ps. 16:10; Luke 24:46; Acts 2:25-31; 13:34, 35; 17:3; 1 Cor. 15:4\x*that he must rise from the dead.
\v 10 Then the disciples went back to their homes.
\s1 Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene
\p
\v 11 But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.
\v 12 And \x + \xo 20:12 \xt [Mark 16:5] \x*she saw \x + \xo 20:12 \xt Luke 24:4\x*two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.
\v 13 They said to her, \x + \xo 20:13 \xt ver. 15; [ch. 2:4] \x*“Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, \x + \xo 20:13 \xt ver. 2\x*“They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”
\v 14 Having said this, she turned around and \x + \xo 20:14 \xt Mark 16:9; [Matt. 28:9] \x*saw Jesus standing, \x + \xo 20:14 \xt ch. 21:4; Luke 24:16, 31\x*but she did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 15 Jesus said to her, \x + \xo 20:15 \xt ver. 13 \x*\wj “Woman, why are you weeping? \wj*\x + \xo 20:15 \xt ch. 1:38; 18:4, 7 \x*\wj Whom are you seeking?”\wj* Supposing him to be \x + \xo 20:15 \xt [ch. 19:41]\x*the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”
\v 16 Jesus said to her, \wj “Mary.”\wj* She turned and said to him in Aramaic,\f + \fr 20:16 \ft Or \fq Hebrew\f* \x + \xo 20:16 \xt See ch. 1:38\x*“Rabboni!” (which means Teacher).
\v 17 Jesus said to her, \wj “Do not cling to me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to \wj*\x + \xo 20:17 \xt See Matt. 28:10 \x*\wj my brothers and say to them, \wj*\x + \xo 20:17 \xt [Mark 16:19]; See ch. 14:12 \x*\wj ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to \wj*\x + \xo 20:17 \xt Matt. 27:46; Eph. 1:17; Rev. 3:2, 12; [1 Cor. 3:23]\x*\wj my God and your God.’”\wj*
\v 18 Mary Magdalene \x + \xo 20:18 \xt Mark 16:10; [Matt. 28:10; Luke 24:10, 22, 23]\x*went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”—and that he had said these things to her.
\s1 Jesus Appears to the Disciples
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 20:19 \xt 1 Cor. 15:5; [ver. 26] \x*On the evening \x + \xo 20:19 \xt Luke 24:33, 36 \x*of that day, the first day of the week, \x + \xo 20:19 \xt ver. 26 \x*the doors being locked where the disciples were \x + \xo 20:19 \xt See ch. 7:13 \x*for fear of the Jews,\f + \fr 20:19 \ft Greek \+tl Ioudaioi\+tl* probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time\f* Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, \x + \xo 20:19 \xt See ch. 14:27\x*\wj “Peace be with you.”\wj*
\v 20 When he had said this, \x + \xo 20:20 \xt Luke 24:40 \x*he showed them his hands and his side. Then \x + \xo 20:20 \xt ch. 16:22\x*the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
\v 21 Jesus said to them again, \wj “Peace be with you. As \wj*\x + \xo 20:21 \xt ch. 17:18; See ch. 3:17 \x*\wj the Father has sent me, \wj*\x + \xo 20:21 \xt ch. 13:20; See Acts 1:2\x*\wj even so I am sending you.”\wj*
\v 22 And when he had said this, he \x + \xo 20:22 \xt Gen. 2:7 \x*breathed on them and said to them, \x + \xo 20:22 \xt [Acts 2:4]; See ch. 7:39\x*\wj “Receive the Holy Spirit.\wj*

\p
\v 26 Eight days later, his disciples were inside again, and Thomas was with them. \x + \xo 20:26 \xt ver. 19\x*Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, \x + \xo 20:26 \xt ver. 19\x*\wj “Peace be with you.”\wj*

\v 28 Thomas answered him, \x + \xo 20:28 \xt [ch. 1:1, 49]\x*“My Lord and my God!”

\s1 The Purpose of This Book

\v 4 Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples \x + \xo 21:4 \xt ch. 20:14\x*did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 5 \x + \xo 21:5 \xt Luke 24:41\x*Jesus said to them, \wj “Children, do you have any fish?”\wj* They answered him, “No.”
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6 \xt [Luke 5:4, 6, 7]\x*He said to them, \wj “Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.”\wj* So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish.
\v 7 That disciple \x + \xo 21:7 \xt See ch. 13:23 \x*whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, \x + \xo 21:7 \xt ver. 18; [ch. 13:4] \x*he put on his outer garment, for he was \x + \xo 21:7 \xt 1 Sam. 19:24; Isa. 20:2; Mic. 1:8 \x*stripped for work, and \x + \xo 21:7 \xt [Matt. 14:29]\x*threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 The other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards\f + \fr 21:8 \ft Greek \fq two hundred \+tl cubits\+tl*; a \+tl cubit\+tl* was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters\f* off.
\p
\v 9 When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire in place, with fish laid out on it, and bread.
\v 10 Jesus said to them, \wj “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.”\wj*
\v 11 So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, 153 of them. And although there were so many, the net was not torn.
\v 12 Jesus said to them, \x + \xo 21:12 \xt Acts 10:41 \x*\wj “Come and \wj*\x + \xo 21:12 \xt ver. 15 \x*\wj have breakfast.”\wj* Now \x + \xo 21:12 \xt [ch. 4:27]\x*none of the disciples dared ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.
\v 13 Jesus came and \x + \xo 21:13 \xt ver. 9\x*took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.
\v 14 \x + \xo 21:14 \xt ver. 1; ch. 20:19, 26\x*This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.
\s1 Jesus and Peter
\p
\v 15 When they had \x + \xo 21:15 \xt ver. 12 \x*finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, \x + \xo 21:15 \xt [Matt. 16:17; Luke 22:31] \x*\wj “Simon, \wj*\x + \xo 21:15 \xt ch. 1:42 \x*\wj son of John, \wj*\x + \xo 21:15 \xt [Matt. 26:33; Mark 14:29] \x*\wj do you love me more than these?”\wj* He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, \wj “Feed \wj*\x + \xo 21:15 \xt ch. 10:11-16; [Isa. 40:11]\x*\wj my lambs.”\wj*
\v 16 He said to him a second time, \wj “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”\wj* He said to him, “Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.” He said to him, \x + \xo 21:16 \xt Acts 20:28; 1 Pet. 5:2; Rev. 7:17 (Gk.) \x*\wj “Tend \wj*\x + \xo 21:16 \xt [See ver. 15 above]\x*\wj my sheep.”\wj*
\v 17 He said to him the third time, \wj “Simon, son of John, do you love me?”\wj* Peter was grieved because he said to him \x + \xo 21:17 \xt [ch. 13:38] \x*the third time, \wj “Do you love me?”\wj* and he said to him, “Lord, \x + \xo 21:17 \xt See ch. 2:25 \x*you know everything; you know that I love you.” Jesus said to him, \wj “Feed \wj*\x + \xo 21:17 \xt ver. 16\x*\wj my sheep.\wj*
\v 18 \x + \xo 21:18 \xt [ch. 13:36] \x*\wj Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, \wj*\x + \xo 21:18 \xt ver. 7\x*\wj you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go.”\wj*
\v 19 (This he said to show \x + \xo 21:19 \xt 2 Pet. 1:14 \x*by what kind of death he was to glorify God.) And after saying this he said to him, \x + \xo 21:19 \xt ver. 22; Matt. 16:24; [ch. 13:36]; See ch. 8:12\x*\wj “Follow me.”\wj*
\s1 Jesus and the Beloved Apostle
\p
\v 20 Peter turned and saw \x + \xo 21:20 \xt ver. 7 \x*the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, \x + \xo 21:20 \xt ch. 13:25\x*the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper and had said, “Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?”
\v 21 When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about this man?”
\v 22 Jesus said to him, \wj “If it is my will that he remain \wj*\x + \xo 21:22 \xt Matt. 10:23; 16:28; 1 Cor. 4:5; 11:26; James 5:7; Rev. 2:25 \x*\wj until \wj*\x + \xo 21:22 \xt [ch. 14:3, 18, 28; Heb. 10:37; Rev. 2:5, 16; 3:3, 11; 16:15; 22:7, 12, 20]; See Matt. 16:27 \x*\wj I come, what is that to you? \wj*\x + \xo 21:22 \xt ver. 19\x*\wj You follow me!”\wj*
\v 23 So the saying spread abroad among \x + \xo 21:23 \xt Acts 1:15; 9:30; 11:1; 12:17; 15:1; 16:2, 40; 21:7, 17; 1 John 3:14, 16\x*the brothers\f + \fr 21:23 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, \wj “If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?”\wj*
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple \x + \xo 21:24 \xt See ch. 15:27 \x*who is bearing witness about these things, and who has written these things, and \x + \xo 21:24 \xt 1 John 3:2, 14; 5:15, 18-20; [ch. 19:35] \x*we know \x + \xo 21:24 \xt 3 John 12\x*that his testimony is true.
\p
\v 25 Now \x + \xo 21:25 \xt ch. 20:30 \x*there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that \x + \xo 21:25 \xt [Amos 7:10]\x*the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.
