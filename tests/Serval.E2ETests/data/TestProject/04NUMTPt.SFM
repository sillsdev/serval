So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the lifetime of Aaron their father.
\s1 Duties of the Levites
\p
\v 5 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,

\p
\v 11 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 “Behold, \x + \xo 3:12 \xt ver. 41; ch. 8:16; 18:6\x*I have taken the Levites from among the people of Israel instead of every firstborn who opens the womb among the people of Israel. The Levites shall be mine,

\p
\v 14 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

\s1 Redemption of the Firstborn

\v 42 So Moses listed all the firstborn among the people of Israel, as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded him.
\v 43 And all the firstborn males, according to the number of names, from a month old and upward as listed were 22,273.
\p

\v 20 But if you have gone astray, though you are under your husband’s authority, and if you have defiled yourself, and some man other than your husband has lain with you,

\v 23 “Then the priest shall write these curses in a book and wash them off into the water of bitterness.
\v 24 And he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain.
\v 25 And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand \x + \xo 5:25 \xt [Lev. 8:27]\x*and shall wave the grain offering before the \nd Lord\nd* and bring it to the altar.
\v 26 And the priest \x + \xo 5:26 \xt Lev. 2:2, 9; 5:12\x*shall take a handful of the grain offering, as its memorial portion, and burn it on the altar, and afterward shall make the woman drink the water.
\v 27 And when he has made her drink the water, then, if she has defiled herself and has broken faith with her husband, the water that brings the curse shall enter into her and cause bitter pain, and her womb shall swell, and her thigh shall fall away, and the woman \x + \xo 5:27 \xt Deut. 28:37; Jer. 24:9; 29:18, 22; 42:18; 44:12; Zech. 8:13\x*shall become a curse among her people.
\v 28 But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she shall be free and shall conceive children.

\v 29 “This is the law in cases of jealousy, when a wife, \x + \xo 5:29 \xt ver. 19, 20\x*though under her husband’s authority, goes astray and defiles herself,
\v 30 or when the spirit of jealousy comes over a man and he is jealous of his wife. Then he shall set the woman before the \nd Lord\nd*, and the priest shall carry out for her all this law.
\v 31 The man shall be free from iniquity, but the woman \x + \xo 5:31 \xt Lev. 20:17, 19, 20\x*shall bear her iniquity.”

\v 5 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,

\v 10 When you bring the Levites before the \nd Lord\nd*, the people of Israel \x + \xo 8:10 \xt [Lev. 1:4]\x*shall lay their hands on the Levites,
\v 11 and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the \nd Lord\nd* as a wave offering from the people of Israel, that they may do the service of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 12 Then the Levites \x + \xo 8:12 \xt [Ex. 29:10] \x*shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer \x + \xo 8:12 \xt ver. 8\x*the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to the \nd Lord\nd* to make atonement for the Levites.

\p
\v 14 “Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the people of Israel, and \x + \xo 8:14 \xt ch. 3:45; [ch. 16:9]\x*the Levites shall be mine.
\v 15 And after that the Levites shall go in to serve at the tent of meeting, when you have cleansed them and offered them as a \x + \xo 8:15 \xt [See ver. 13 above]\x*wave offering.
\v 16 For they are \x + \xo 8:16 \xt ch. 3:9 \x*wholly given to me from among the people of Israel. \x + \xo 8:16 \xt ch. 3:12, 45\x*Instead of all who open the womb, the firstborn of all the people of Israel, I have taken them for myself.
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17 \xt See Ex. 13:2\x*For all the firstborn among the people of Israel are mine, both of man and of beast. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I consecrated them for myself,
\v 18 and I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the people of Israel.
\v 19 \x + \xo 8:19 \xt [See ver. 16 above] \x*And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and his sons from among the people of Israel, to do the service for the people of Israel at the tent of meeting and \x + \xo 8:19 \xt ch. 25:11, 13 \x*to make atonement for the people of Israel, \x + \xo 8:19 \xt See ch. 1:53\x*that there may be no plague among the people of Israel when the people of Israel come near the sanctuary.”
\p
\v 20 Thus did Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the people of Israel to the Levites. According to all that the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses concerning the Levites, the people of Israel did to them.
\v 21 And \x + \xo 8:21 \xt ver. 7 \x*the Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and \x + \xo 8:21 \xt ver. 11, 12, 13, 15\x*Aaron offered them as a wave offering before the \nd Lord\nd*, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.
\v 22 And after that the Levites went in to do their service in the tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons; as the \nd Lord\nd* had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.
\s1 Retirement of the Levites
\p
\v 23 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 24 “This applies to the Levites: \x + \xo 8:24 \xt [ch. 4:3; 1 Chr. 23:3, 24, 27]\x*from twenty-five years old and upward they\f + \fr 8:24 \ft Hebrew \fq he\ft ; also verses 25, 26\f* shall come to do duty in the service of the tent of meeting.

\s1 The Passover Celebrated
\p \v 1 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, \x + \xo 9:1 \xt [ch. 1:1]\x*in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,
\v 2 “Let the people of Israel keep the Passover at its appointed time.
\v 3 \x + \xo 9:3 \xt See Lev. 23:5\x*On the fourteenth day of this month, at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and all its rules you shall keep it.”
\v 4 So Moses told the people of Israel that they should keep the Passover.
\v 5 And they kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at twilight, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses, so the people of Israel did.
\v 6 And there were certain men who were \x + \xo 9:6 \xt ch. 5:2; 19:11, 16; [John 18:28] \x*unclean through touching a dead body, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and \x + \xo 9:6 \xt ch. 27:2; Ex. 18:15, 19, 26\x*they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
\v 7 And those men said to him, “We are unclean through touching a dead body. Why are we kept from bringing the \nd Lord\nd*’s \x + \xo 9:7 \xt ver. 13\x*offering at its appointed time among the people of Israel?”
\v 8 And Moses said to them, “Wait, that \x + \xo 9:8 \xt ch. 27:5\x*I may hear what the \nd Lord\nd* will command concerning you.”
\p
\v 9 The \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 10 “Speak to the people of Israel, saying, If any one of you or of your descendants is unclean through touching a dead body, or is on a long journey, he shall still keep the Passover to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11 \xt See Ex. 12:6; 2 Chr. 30:2-15 \x*In the second month on the fourteenth day at twilight they shall keep it. \x + \xo 9:11 \xt Ex. 12:8; [Deut. 16:3]\x*They shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

\v 13 But if anyone who is clean and is not on a journey fails to keep the Passover, \x + \xo 9:13 \xt Ex. 12:15; [Gen. 17:14] \x*that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not bring the \nd Lord\nd*’s \x + \xo 9:13 \xt ver. 7\x*offering at its appointed time; that man shall bear his sin.
\v 14 And if a stranger sojourns among you and would keep the Passover to the \nd Lord\nd*, according to the statute of the Passover and according to its rule, so shall he do. \x + \xo 9:14 \xt Ex. 12:48, 49\x*You shall have one statute, both for the sojourner and for the native.”
\s1 The Cloud Covering the Tabernacle
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 9:15 \xt Ex. 40:17, 34 \x*On the day that the tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, the tent of the testimony. And \x + \xo 9:15 \xt See Ex. 13:21\x*at evening it was over the tabernacle like the appearance of fire until morning.
\v 16 So it was always: the cloud covered it by day\f + \fr 9:16 \ft Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate; Hebrew lacks \fq by day\f* and the appearance of fire by night.
\v 17 And whenever the cloud \x + \xo 9:17 \xt ch. 10:11, 33, 34; Ex. 40:36\x*lifted from over the tent, after that the people of Israel set out, and in the place where the cloud settled down, there the people of Israel camped.
\v 18 At the command of the \nd Lord\nd* the people of Israel set out, and at the command of the \nd Lord\nd* they camped. \x + \xo 9:18 \xt [1 Cor. 10:1]\x*As long as the cloud rested over the tabernacle, they remained in camp.
\v 19 Even when the cloud continued over the tabernacle many days, the people of Israel \x + \xo 9:19 \xt See ch. 1:53\x*kept the charge of the \nd Lord\nd* and did not set out.
\v 20 Sometimes the cloud was a few days over the tabernacle, and according to the command of the \nd Lord\nd* they remained in camp; then according to the command of the \nd Lord\nd* they set out.
\v 21 And sometimes the cloud remained from evening until morning. And when the cloud lifted in the morning, they set out, or if it continued for a day and a night, when the cloud lifted they set out.
\v 22 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a longer time, that the cloud continued over the tabernacle, abiding there, the people of Israel \x + \xo 9:22 \xt Ex. 40:36, 37\x*remained in camp and did not set out, but when it lifted they set out.
\v 23 At the command of the \nd Lord\nd* they camped, and at the command of the \nd Lord\nd* they set out. \x + \xo 9:23 \xt [See ver. 19 above]\x*They kept the charge of the \nd Lord\nd*, at the command of the \nd Lord\nd* by Moses.

\p
\v 21 Then the Kohathites set out, \x + \xo 10:21 \xt ch. 7:9; See ch. 4:4-15 \x*carrying the holy things, and \x + \xo 10:21 \xt [ver. 17]\x*the tabernacle was set up before their arrival.
\v 22 And \x + \xo 10:22 \xt See ch. 2:18-24 \x*the standard of the camp of the people of Ephraim set out by their companies, and over their company was \x + \xo 10:22 \xt ch. 1:10\x*Elishama the son of Ammihud.

\v 24 And over the company of the tribe of the people of Benjamin was \x + \xo 10:24 \xt ch. 1:11\x*Abidan the son of Gideoni.
\p
\v 25 Then \x + \xo 10:25 \xt See ch. 2:25-31 \x*the standard of the camp of the people of Dan, acting as the \x + \xo 10:25 \xt [Josh. 6:9] \x*rear guard of all the camps, set out by their companies, and over their company was \x + \xo 10:25 \xt ch. 1:12\x*Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
\v 26 And over the company of the tribe of the people of Asher was \x + \xo 10:26 \xt ch. 1:13\x*Pagiel the son of Ochran.
\v 27 And over the company of the tribe of the people of Naphtali was \x + \xo 10:27 \xt ch. 1:15\x*Ahira the son of Enan.
\v 28 \x + \xo 10:28 \xt ch. 2:34\x*This was the order of march of the people of Israel by their companies, when they set out.
\p
\v 29 And Moses said to Hobab the son of \x + \xo 10:29 \xt See Ex. 2:18 \x*Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are setting out for the place of which the \nd Lord\nd* said, \x + \xo 10:29 \xt Gen. 12:7 \x*‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will do good to you, for \x + \xo 10:29 \xt Gen. 32:12; Ex. 3:8; 6:7, 8\x*the \nd Lord\nd* has promised good to Israel.”
\v 30 But he said to him, “I will not go. I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.”
\v 31 And he said, “Please do not leave us, for you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you will serve \x + \xo 10:31 \xt [Job 29:15]\x*as eyes for us.
\v 32 And if you do go with us, \x + \xo 10:32 \xt ver. 29; [Judg. 1:16; 4:11]\x*whatever good the \nd Lord\nd* will do to us, the same will we do to you.”
\p
\v 33 So they set out from \x + \xo 10:33 \xt See Ex. 3:1 \x*the mount of the \nd Lord\nd* three days’ journey. And the ark of the covenant of the \nd Lord\nd* went before them three days’ journey, to seek out \x + \xo 10:33 \xt Ps. 132:8; Jer. 31:2\x*a resting place for them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 10:34 \xt See Ex. 13:21\x*And the cloud of the \nd Lord\nd* was over them by day, whenever they set out from the camp.
\p
\v 35 And whenever the ark set out, Moses said, \x + \xo 10:35 \xt Ps. 68:1, 2\x*“Arise, O \nd Lord\nd*, and let your enemies be scattered, and let those who hate you flee before you.”
\v 36 And when it rested, he said, “Return, O \nd Lord\nd*, to the ten thousand thousands of Israel.”
\c 11
\s1 The People Complain
\p \v 1 And \x + \xo 11:1 \xt Deut. 9:22 \x*the people complained in the hearing of the \nd Lord\nd* about their misfortunes, and when the \nd Lord\nd* heard it, \x + \xo 11:1 \xt Ps. 78:21 \x*his anger was kindled, and \x + \xo 11:1 \xt [ch. 16:35; Lev. 10:2; 2 Kgs. 1:12; Ps. 106:18; Rev. 13:13]\x*the fire of the \nd Lord\nd* burned among them and consumed some outlying parts of the camp.
\v 2 Then \x + \xo 11:2 \xt [ch. 21:7] \x*the people cried out to Moses, \x + \xo 11:2 \xt [James 5:16]; See ch. 16:45-48\x*and Moses prayed to the \nd Lord\nd*, and the fire died down.
\v 3 So the name of that place was called \x + \xo 11:3 \xt Deut. 9:22\x*Taberah,\f + \fr 11:3 \fq Taberah \ft means \fq burning\f* because the fire of the \nd Lord\nd* burned among them.
\p
\v 4 Now the \x + \xo 11:4 \xt See Ex. 12:38 \x*rabble that was among them had a strong craving. And the people of Israel also \x + \xo 11:4 \xt ch. 14:1 \x*wept again and said, \x + \xo 11:4 \xt Ps. 78:18; 106:14; 1 Cor. 10:6\x*“Oh that we had meat to eat!
\v 5 \x + \xo 11:5 \xt [ch. 21:5; Ex. 16:3; Acts 7:39]\x*We remember the fish we ate in Egypt that cost nothing, the cucumbers, the melons, the leeks, the onions, and the garlic.
\v 6 But now our strength is dried up, and there is nothing at all but this manna to look at.”
\p
\v 7 Now \x + \xo 11:7 \xt Ex. 16:14, 31\x*the manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like that of bdellium.
\v 8 \x + \xo 11:8 \xt Ex. 16:16-18 \x*The people went about and gathered it and ground it in handmills or beat it in mortars and boiled it in pots and made cakes of it. \x + \xo 11:8 \xt [Ex. 16:31]\x*And the taste of it was like the taste of cakes baked with oil.
\v 9 \x + \xo 11:9 \xt Ex. 16:13, 14\x*When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell with it.
\p
\v 10 Moses heard the people \x + \xo 11:10 \xt [Zech. 12:12-14]\x*weeping throughout their clans, everyone at the door of his tent. And the anger of the \nd Lord\nd* blazed hotly, and Moses was displeased.
\v 11 \x + \xo 11:11 \xt [1 Kgs. 19:4; Jonah 4:1-4, 9]\x*Moses said to the \nd Lord\nd*, “Why have you dealt ill with your servant? And why have I not found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?
\v 12 Did I conceive all this people? Did I give them birth, that you should say to me, \x + \xo 11:12 \xt Isa. 40:11; [Deut. 1:31] \x*‘Carry them in your bosom, as a \x + \xo 11:12 \xt [Isa. 49:23; 1 Thess. 2:7] \x*nurse carries a nursing child,’ to the land \x + \xo 11:12 \xt Gen. 50:24; Ex. 13:5\x*that you swore to give their fathers?
\v 13 \x + \xo 11:13 \xt [2 Kgs. 7:2; Matt. 15:33; Mark 8:4; John 6:7, 9]\x*Where am I to get meat to give to all this people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, that we may eat.’
\v 14 \x + \xo 11:14 \xt Ex. 18:18; Deut. 1:9, 12\x*I am not able to carry all this people alone; the burden is too heavy for me.
\v 15 If you will treat me like this, kill me at once, if I find favor in your sight, that I may not see my wretchedness.”
\s1 Elders Appointed to Aid Moses
\p
\v 16 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses, “Gather for me \x + \xo 11:16 \xt [Ex. 24:1, 9] \x*seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people and \x + \xo 11:16 \xt Deut. 1:15; 16:18\x*officers over them, and bring them to the tent of meeting, and let them take their stand there with you.
\v 17 \x + \xo 11:17 \xt ver. 25; ch. 12:5; Gen. 11:5; 18:21; Ex. 19:20 \x*And I will come down and talk with you there. And \x + \xo 11:17 \xt [2 Kgs. 2:9, 15; Neh. 9:20] \x*I will take some of the Spirit that is on you and put it on them, and \x + \xo 11:17 \xt Ex. 18:22\x*they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you may not bear it yourself alone.
\v 18 And say to the people, \x + \xo 11:18 \xt Ex. 19:10 \x*‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat, for you have wept in the hearing of the \nd Lord\nd*, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? \x + \xo 11:18 \xt See ver. 5\x*For it was better for us in Egypt.” Therefore the \nd Lord\nd* will give you meat, and you shall eat.
\v 19 You shall not eat just one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days,
\v 20 but a whole month, \x + \xo 11:20 \xt [Ps. 78:29; 106:15] \x*until it comes out at your nostrils and becomes loathsome to you, because you have rejected the \nd Lord\nd* who is among you and have wept before him, saying, \x + \xo 11:20 \xt ch. 21:5\x*“Why did we come out of Egypt?”’”
\v 21 But Moses said, \x + \xo 11:21 \xt Ex. 12:37; [ch. 1:46; Ex. 38:26]\x*“The people among whom I am number six hundred thousand on foot, and you have said, ‘I will give them meat, that they may eat a whole month!’
\v 22 \x + \xo 11:22 \xt [ver. 13]\x*Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, and be enough for them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, and be enough for them?”
\v 23 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses, \x + \xo 11:23 \xt Isa. 50:2; 59:1 \x*“Is the \nd Lord\nd*’s hand shortened? Now you shall see whether \x + \xo 11:23 \xt ch. 23:19; Ezek. 12:25; 24:14\x*my word will come true for you or not.”
\p
\v 24 So Moses went out and told the people the words of the \nd Lord\nd*. \x + \xo 11:24 \xt ver. 16\x*And he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people and placed them around the tent.
\v 25 Then \x + \xo 11:25 \xt ver. 17\x*the \nd Lord\nd* came down in the cloud and spoke to him, and took some of the Spirit that was on him and put it on the seventy elders. And as soon as the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied. But they did not continue doing it.
\p
\v 26 Now two men remained in the camp, one named Eldad, and the other named Medad, and the Spirit rested on them. They were among those registered, but they \x + \xo 11:26 \xt [1 Sam. 20:26; Jer. 36:5]\x*had not gone out to the tent, and so they prophesied in the camp.
\v 27 And a young man ran and told Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
\v 28 And \x + \xo 11:28 \xt ch. 26:65; Ex. 24:13; [ch. 13:8]; See ch. 13:16 \x*Joshua the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses from his youth, said, “My lord Moses, \x + \xo 11:28 \xt [Mark 9:38; Luke 9:49]\x*stop them.”
\v 29 But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? \x + \xo 11:29 \xt [1 Cor. 14:5]\x*Would that all the \nd Lord\nd*’s people were prophets, that the \nd Lord\nd* would put his Spirit on them!”
\v 30 And Moses and the elders of Israel returned to the camp.
\s1 Quail and a Plague
\p
\v 31 Then a \x + \xo 11:31 \xt Ex. 16:13; Ps. 78:26-28; 105:40\x*wind from the \nd Lord\nd* sprang up, and it brought quail from the sea and let them fall beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and a day’s journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits\f + \fr 11:31 \ft A \fq cubit \ft was about 18 inches or 45 centimeters\f* above the ground.
\v 32 And the people rose all that day and all night and all the next day, and gathered the quail. Those who gathered least gathered ten \x + \xo 11:32 \xt Ex. 16:36; [Ezek. 45:11]\x*homers.\f + \fr 11:32 \ft A \fq homer \ft was about 6 bushels or 220 liters\f* And they spread them out for themselves all around the camp.
\v 33 \x + \xo 11:33 \xt Ps. 78:30, 31 \x*While the meat was yet between their teeth, before it was consumed, the anger of the \nd Lord\nd* was kindled against the people, and \x + \xo 11:33 \xt [ch. 16:49]\x*the \nd Lord\nd* struck down the people with a very great plague.
\v 34 Therefore the name of that place was called \x + \xo 11:34 \xt Deut. 9:22\x*Kibroth-hattaavah,\f + \fr 11:34 \fq Kibroth-hattaavah \ft means \fq graves of craving\f* because there they buried the people who had the craving.
\v 35 \x + \xo 11:35 \xt ch. 33:17 \x*From Kibroth-hattaavah the people journeyed to \x + \xo 11:35 \xt ch. 12:16; 33:17, 18\x*Hazeroth, and they remained at \x + \xo 11:35 \xt ch. 12:16; 33:17, 18\x*Hazeroth.
\c 12
\s1 Miriam and Aaron Oppose Moses
\p \v 1 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married, for he had married a Cushite woman.
\v 2 And they said, “Has the \nd Lord\nd* indeed spoken only through Moses? \x + \xo 12:2 \xt Mic. 6:4 \x*Has he not spoken through us also?” And \x + \xo 12:2 \xt ch. 11:1; 2 Kgs. 19:4; Isa. 37:4; Ezek. 35:12, 13; [Mal. 3:16]\x*the \nd Lord\nd* heard it.
\v 3 Now the man Moses was very meek, more than all people who were on the face of the earth.
\v 4 And suddenly the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the tent of meeting.” And the three of them came out.
\v 5 And \x + \xo 12:5 \xt ch. 11:25; 16:19\x*the \nd Lord\nd* came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forward.
\v 6 And he said, “Hear my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the \nd Lord\nd* make myself known to him \x + \xo 12:6 \xt Gen. 46:2; Ezek. 1:1; Dan. 8:2; 10:8, 16; Luke 1:11, 22; Acts 10:11; 22:17, 18 \x*in a vision; I speak with him \x + \xo 12:6 \xt Gen. 20:6; 31:10, 11; 1 Kgs. 3:5; Job 33:15; Matt. 1:20; 27:19\x*in a dream.
\v 7 Not so with \x + \xo 12:7 \xt Ps. 105:26 \x*my servant Moses. \x + \xo 12:7 \xt Heb. 3:2, 5\x*He is faithful in all my house.
\v 8 With him I speak \x + \xo 12:8 \xt ch. 7:89; [Ex. 33:11; Deut. 34:10; 1 Cor. 13:12] \x*mouth to mouth, clearly, and not in \x + \xo 12:8 \xt Ps. 49:4; 78:2; Prov. 1:6 \x*riddles, and he beholds \x + \xo 12:8 \xt [Ex. 33:20, 23]\x*the form of the \nd Lord\nd*. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?”
\v 9 And the anger of the \nd Lord\nd* was kindled against them, and he departed.
\p
\v 10 When the cloud removed from over the tent, behold, \x + \xo 12:10 \xt Deut. 24:9 \x*Miriam was \x + \xo 12:10 \xt See Lev. 13:10\x*leprous,\f + \fr 12:10 \fq Leprosy \ft was a term for several skin diseases; see Leviticus 13\f* like snow. And Aaron turned toward Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.
\v 11 And Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, \x + \xo 12:11 \xt [2 Sam. 19:19; 24:10; Prov. 30:32]\x*do not punish us\f + \fr 12:11 \ft Hebrew \fq do not lay sin upon us\f* because we have done foolishly and have sinned.
\v 12 Let her not be as one dead, whose flesh is half eaten away when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”
\v 13 And Moses cried to the \nd Lord\nd*, “O God, please heal her—please.”
\v 14 But the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses, “If her father had but \x + \xo 12:14 \xt Deut. 25:9; Job 30:10 \x*spit in her face, should she not be shamed seven days? Let her be \x + \xo 12:14 \xt See Lev. 13:46\x*shut outside the camp seven days, and after that she may be brought in again.”
\v 15 So Miriam \x + \xo 12:15 \xt [2 Kgs. 15:5; 2 Chr. 26:20, 21; Luke 17:12]\x*was shut outside the camp seven days, and the people did not set out on the march till Miriam was brought in again.
\v 16 After that the people set out from \x + \xo 12:16 \xt ch. 11:35; [ch. 33:18] \x*Hazeroth, and camped in \x + \xo 12:16 \xt See ch. 10:12\x*the wilderness of Paran.
\c 13
\s1 Spies Sent into Canaan
\p \v 1 The \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 13:2 \xt ch. 32:8; See Deut. 1:22-25\x*“Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the people of Israel. From each tribe of their fathers you shall send a man, every one a chief among them.”
\v 3 So Moses sent them from \x + \xo 13:3 \xt ver. 26; ch. 12:16; 32:8; Deut. 1:19; 9:23\x*the wilderness of Paran, according to the command of the \nd Lord\nd*, all of them men who were heads of the people of Israel.
\v 4 And these were their names: From the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur;

\v 9 from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu;
\v 10 from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
\v 11 from the tribe of Joseph (that is, from the tribe of Manasseh), Gaddi the son of Susi;
\v 12 from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli;
\v 13 from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael;
\v 14 from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
\v 15 from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.
\v 16 These were the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called \x + \xo 13:16 \xt [See ver. 8 above]\x*Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.
\p
\v 17 Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said to them, “Go up into \x + \xo 13:17 \xt ver. 22, 29; ch. 21:1; Josh. 15:19; Judg. 1:15 \x*the Negeb and go up into \x + \xo 13:17 \xt ver. 29; Judg. 1:9, 19\x*the hill country,
\v 18 and see what the land is, and whether the people who dwell in it are strong or weak, whether they are few or many,
\v 19 and whether the land that they dwell in is good or bad, and whether the cities that they dwell in are camps or strongholds,
\v 20 and whether the land is \x + \xo 13:20 \xt Neh. 9:25, 35; Ezek. 34:14 \x*rich or poor, and whether there are trees in it or not. \x + \xo 13:20 \xt Deut. 31:6, 7, 23\x*Be of good courage and bring some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the season of the first ripe grapes.
\p
\v 21 So they went up and spied out the land \x + \xo 13:21 \xt ch. 20:1; 33:36; 34:3; Josh. 15:1 \x*from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, \x + \xo 13:21 \xt ch. 34:8\x*near Lebo-hamath.

\v 3 Why is the \nd Lord\nd* bringing us into this land, to fall by the sword? \x + \xo 14:3 \xt ver. 31\x*Our wives and our little ones will become a prey. Would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt?”

\p
\v 5 Then \x + \xo 14:5 \xt ch. 16:4, 22; 20:6\x*Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the people of Israel.

\v 20 Then the \nd Lord\nd* said, “I have pardoned, \x + \xo 14:20 \xt Ps. 106:23; [James 5:16]; See 1 John 5:14-16\x*according to your word.

\v 39 When Moses told these words to all the people of Israel, the people \x + \xo 14:39 \xt Ex. 33:4\x*mourned greatly.

\v 6 Do this: take \x + \xo 16:6 \xt Lev. 10:1\x*censers, Korah and all his company;
\v 7 put fire in them and put incense on them before the \nd Lord\nd* tomorrow, and the man whom the \nd Lord\nd* chooses shall be the holy one. \x + \xo 16:7 \xt ver. 3\x*You have gone too far, sons of Levi!”
\v 8 And Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi:
\v 9 is it \x + \xo 16:9 \xt ver. 13; 1 Sam. 18:23; Isa. 7:13; [Ezek. 16:20] \x*too small a thing for you that the God of Israel has \x + \xo 16:9 \xt ch. 8:14; Deut. 10:8\x*separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do service in the tabernacle of the \nd Lord\nd* and to stand before the congregation to minister to them,
\v 10 and that he has brought you near him, and all your brothers the sons of Levi with you? And would you seek the priesthood also?
\v 11 Therefore it is against the \nd Lord\nd* that you and all your company have gathered together. What is \x + \xo 16:11 \xt Ex. 16:8; [1 Cor. 3:5]\x*Aaron that you grumble against him?”
\p
\v 12 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and they said, “We will not come up.
\v 13 Is it \x + \xo 16:13 \xt ver. 9 \x*a small thing that you have brought us up out of \x + \xo 16:13 \xt See Ex. 3:8 \x*a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, that you must also \x + \xo 16:13 \xt Ex. 2:14; Acts 7:27, 35\x*make yourself a prince over us?
\v 14 Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.”
\v 15 And Moses was very angry and said to the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 16:15 \xt [Gen. 4:4, 5] \x*“Do not respect their offering. \x + \xo 16:15 \xt 1 Sam. 12:3; [Acts 20:33; 2 Cor. 7:2]\x*I have not taken one donkey from them, and I have not harmed one of them.”
\p
\v 16 And Moses said to Korah, “Be present, you and all your company, \x + \xo 16:16 \xt Ex. 16:9; 1 Sam. 12:3, 7\x*before the \nd Lord\nd*, you and they, and Aaron, tomorrow.
\v 17 And \x + \xo 16:17 \xt ver. 6, 7 \x*let every one of you take his censer and put incense on it, and every one of you bring before the \nd Lord\nd* his censer, \x + \xo 16:17 \xt ver. 35\x*250 censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.”
\v 18 So every man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense on them and stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
\v 19 Then Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the entrance of the tent of meeting. \x + \xo 16:19 \xt See Lev. 9:23\x*And the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* appeared to all the congregation.
\p
\v 20 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\v 21 \x + \xo 16:21 \xt ver. 45; [Gen. 19:17, 22; Jer. 51:6; Rev. 18:4] \x*“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them \x + \xo 16:21 \xt Ex. 33:5; Ps. 73:19\x*in a moment.”
\v 22 And they \x + \xo 16:22 \xt ver. 45; ch. 14:5; 20:6 \x*fell on their faces and said, “O God, \x + \xo 16:22 \xt ch. 27:16; Job 12:10; Eccles. 12:7; Isa. 57:16; Zech. 12:1 \x*the God of the spirits of all flesh, \x + \xo 16:22 \xt [Gen. 18:23-25; 2 Sam. 24:17]\x*shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?”
\v 23 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 24 “Say to the congregation, Get away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.”
\p
\v 25 Then Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
\v 26 And he spoke to the congregation, saying, \x + \xo 16:26 \xt [Gen. 19:12-14; Isa. 52:11; 2 Cor. 6:17; Rev. 18:4]\x*“Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be swept away with all their sins.”
\v 27 So they got away from the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. And Dathan and Abiram came out and stood \x + \xo 16:27 \xt [Ex. 33:8]\x*at the door of their tents, together with their wives, their sons, and their little ones.
\v 28 And Moses said, “Hereby you shall know that the \nd Lord\nd* has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been \x + \xo 16:28 \xt [Jer. 23:16; Ezek. 13:2, 17]\x*of my own accord.
\v 29 If these men die as all men die, or if they are visited by the fate of all mankind, \x + \xo 16:29 \xt [1 Kgs. 22:28]\x*then the \nd Lord\nd* has not sent me.
\v 30 But if the \nd Lord\nd* creates something new, and \x + \xo 16:30 \xt [Gen. 4:11] \x*the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up with all that belongs to them, and they \x + \xo 16:30 \xt ver. 33; Ps. 55:15\x*go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\p
\v 31 \x + \xo 16:31 \xt ch. 26:10; 27:3; Deut. 11:6; Ps. 106:17\x*And as soon as he had finished speaking all these words, the ground under them split apart.
\v 32 And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up, with their households and \x + \xo 16:32 \xt [ch. 26:11; 1 Chr. 6:22, 27]\x*all the people who belonged to Korah and all their goods.
\v 33 So they and all that belonged to them went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed over them, and \x + \xo 16:33 \xt Jude 11\x*they perished from the midst of the assembly.
\v 34 And all Israel who were around them fled at their cry, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us up!”
\v 35 And \x + \xo 16:35 \xt [ch. 11:1]; Lev. 10:2; Ps. 106:18 \x*fire came out from the \nd Lord\nd* and consumed \x + \xo 16:35 \xt ver. 17\x*the 250 men offering the incense.
\p
\v 36 \f + \fr 16:36 \ft Ch 17:1 in Hebrew\f* Then the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 37 “Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest to take up the censers out of the blaze. Then scatter the fire far and wide, for they have become holy.
\v 38 As for the censers of \x + \xo 16:38 \xt Prov. 20:2; Hab. 2:10; [1 Kgs. 2:23] \x*these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, let them be made into hammered plates as a covering for the altar, for they offered them before the \nd Lord\nd*, and they became holy. \x + \xo 16:38 \xt ch. 17:10; 26:10\x*Thus they shall be a sign to the people of Israel.”
\v 39 So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burned had offered, and they were hammered out as a covering for the altar,
\v 40 to be a reminder to the people of Israel, so \x + \xo 16:40 \xt ch. 3:10; 2 Chr. 26:18\x*that no outsider, who is not of the descendants of Aaron, should draw near to burn incense before the \nd Lord\nd*, lest he become like Korah and his company—as the \nd Lord\nd* said to him through Moses.
\p
\v 41 But on the next day all the congregation of the people of Israel \x + \xo 16:41 \xt See ch. 14:2\x*grumbled against Moses and against Aaron, saying, “You have killed the people of the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 42 And when the congregation had assembled against Moses and against Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting. And behold, \x + \xo 16:42 \xt Ex. 40:34 \x*the cloud covered it, and \x + \xo 16:42 \xt ver. 19; See Lev. 9:23\x*the glory of the \nd Lord\nd* appeared.
\v 43 And Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting,
\v 44 and the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 45 \x + \xo 16:45 \xt ver. 21, 24 \x*“Get away from the midst of this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment.” \x + \xo 16:45 \xt ver. 22\x*And they fell on their faces.
\v 46 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take your censer, and put fire on it from off the altar and lay incense on it and carry it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for \x + \xo 16:46 \xt ch. 8:19; 11:33; Lev. 10:6; 1 Chr. 27:24\x*wrath has gone out from the \nd Lord\nd*; the plague has begun.”
\v 47 So Aaron took it as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had already begun among the people. And he put on the incense and made atonement for the people.
\v 48 And he stood between the dead and the living, and \x + \xo 16:48 \xt ver. 50; ch. 25:8; 2 Sam. 24:25; Ps. 106:30\x*the plague was stopped.
\v 49 Now those who died in the plague were 14,700, \x + \xo 16:49 \xt ch. 27:3\x*besides those who died in the affair of Korah.
\v 50 And Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting, when the plague was stopped.
\c 17
\s1 Aaron’s Staff Buds
\p \v 1 \f + \fr 17:1 \ft Ch 17:16 in Hebrew\f* The \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 17:2 \xt [Ezek. 37:16]\x*“Speak to the people of Israel, and get from them staffs, one for each fathers’ house, from all their chiefs according to their fathers’ houses, twelve staffs. Write each man’s name on his staff,
\v 3 and write Aaron’s name on the staff of Levi. For there shall be one staff for the head of each fathers’ house.
\v 4 Then you shall deposit them in the tent of meeting before the testimony, \x + \xo 17:4 \xt See Ex. 25:22\x*where I meet with you.
\v 5 And the staff of the man \x + \xo 17:5 \xt ch. 16:5 \x*whom I choose shall sprout. Thus I will make to cease from me \x + \xo 17:5 \xt ch. 16:11\x*the grumblings of the people of Israel, which they grumble against you.”
\v 6 Moses spoke to the people of Israel. And all their chiefs gave him staffs, one for each chief, according to their fathers’ houses, twelve staffs. And the staff of Aaron was among their staffs.
\v 7 And Moses deposited the staffs before the \nd Lord\nd* in \x + \xo 17:7 \xt ch. 18:2; Ex. 38:21; 2 Chr. 24:6; Acts 7:44\x*the tent of the testimony.
\p
\v 8 On the next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony, and behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had sprouted and put forth buds and produced blossoms, and it bore ripe almonds.
\v 9 Then Moses brought out all the staffs from before the \nd Lord\nd* to all the people of Israel. And they looked, and each man took his staff.
\v 10 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses, “Put back \x + \xo 17:10 \xt Heb. 9:4 \x*the staff of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept \x + \xo 17:10 \xt ch. 16:38 \x*as a sign for the rebels, \x + \xo 17:10 \xt ver. 5\x*that you may make an end of their grumblings against me, lest they die.”
\v 11 Thus did Moses; as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded him, so he did.
\p
\v 12 And the people of Israel said to Moses, “Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.
\v 13 \x + \xo 17:13 \xt See ch. 1:51\x*Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tabernacle of the \nd Lord\nd*, shall die. Are we all to perish?”
\c 18
\s1 Duties of Priests and Levites
\p \v 1 So the \nd Lord\nd* said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s house with you shall \x + \xo 18:1 \xt ver. 23; See Ex. 28:38 \x*bear iniquity connected with the sanctuary, \x + \xo 18:1 \xt ver. 23\x*and you and your sons with you shall bear iniquity connected with your priesthood.
\v 2 And with you bring your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, that they may \x + \xo 18:2 \xt [Gen. 29:34] \x*join you and \x + \xo 18:2 \xt See ch. 3:6-10\x*minister to you while you and your sons with you are before the tent of the testimony.
\v 3 They shall keep guard over you and \x + \xo 18:3 \xt ch. 3:25, 31, 36 \x*over the whole tent, \x + \xo 18:3 \xt ch. 16:40 \x*but shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary or to the altar \x + \xo 18:3 \xt ch. 4:15\x*lest they, and you, die.
\v 4 They shall join you and keep guard over the tent of meeting for all the service of the tent, \x + \xo 18:4 \xt See ch. 17:13\x*and no outsider shall come near you.
\v 5 And you shall \x + \xo 18:5 \xt ch. 3:38; Ex. 27:21; 30:7; Lev. 24:3 \x*keep guard over the sanctuary and over the altar, \x + \xo 18:5 \xt See Lev. 10:6\x*that there may never again be wrath on the people of Israel.
\v 6 \x + \xo 18:6 \xt ch. 3:12, 45 \x*And behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the people of Israel. \x + \xo 18:6 \xt ch. 3:9; 8:19\x*They are a gift to you, given to the \nd Lord\nd*, to do the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 7 And \x + \xo 18:7 \xt ch. 3:10 \x*you and your sons with you shall guard your priesthood for all that concerns the altar and \x + \xo 18:7 \xt Heb. 9:3, 6 \x*that is within the veil; and you shall serve.

\p
\v 8 Then the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Aaron, “Behold, \x + \xo 18:8 \xt ch. 5:9; Lev. 7:32 \x*I have given you charge of the contributions made to me, all the consecrated things of the people of Israel. I have given them to you \x + \xo 18:8 \xt Ex. 29:29; 40:13, 15\x*as a portion and to your sons as a perpetual due.

\v 11 This also is yours: the contribution of their gift, all the \x + \xo 18:11 \xt Ex. 29:27, 28; Lev. 7:30, 34 \x*wave offerings of the people of Israel.

\v 13 The first ripe fruits of all that is in their land, \x + \xo 18:13 \xt Ex. 22:29; Lev. 2:14; Deut. 26:2 \x*which they bring to the \nd Lord\nd*, shall be yours. \x + \xo 18:13 \xt [See ver. 11 above]\x*Everyone who is clean in your house may eat it.
\v 14 \x + \xo 18:14 \xt Lev. 27:28\x*Every devoted thing in Israel shall be yours.
\v 15 \x + \xo 18:15 \xt See Ex. 13:2 \x*Everything that opens the womb of all flesh, whether man or beast, which they offer to the \nd Lord\nd*, shall be yours. Nevertheless, \x + \xo 18:15 \xt Ex. 13:13; 34:20\x*the firstborn of man you shall redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem.
\v 16 And their redemption price \x + \xo 18:16 \xt ch. 3:47; Lev. 27:2, 6 \x*(at a month old you shall redeem them) you shall fix at five shekels\f + \fr 18:16 \ft A \fq shekel \ft was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams\f* in silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, \x + \xo 18:16 \xt See Ex. 30:13\x*which is twenty gerahs.
\v 17 \x + \xo 18:17 \xt Deut. 15:19\x*But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall burn their fat as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 18 But their flesh shall be yours, as \x + \xo 18:18 \xt Ex. 29:26, 28; Lev. 7:31, 32, 34\x*the breast that is waved and as the right thigh are yours.

\v 20 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any portion among them. \x + \xo 18:20 \xt ver. 23, 24; Deut. 10:9; 12:12; 14:27; 18:1, 2; Josh. 13:33; 14:3; 18:7; Ezek. 44:28\x*I am your portion and your inheritance among the people of Israel.

\p
\v 25 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,

\v 28 So you shall also present a contribution to the \nd Lord\nd* from all your tithes, which you receive from the people of Israel. And from it you shall give the \nd Lord\nd*’s contribution to Aaron the priest.
\v 29 Out of all the gifts to you, you shall present every contribution due to the \nd Lord\nd*; from each its best part is to be dedicated.’
\v 30 Therefore you shall say to them, ‘When you have offered from it the best of it, \x + \xo 18:30 \xt ver. 27\x*then the rest shall be counted to the Levites as produce of the threshing floor, and as produce of the winepress.
\v 31 And you may eat it in any place, you and your households, for it is \x + \xo 18:31 \xt [Matt. 10:10; Luke 10:7; 1 Tim. 5:17, 18]; See 1 Cor. 9:4-14\x*your reward in return for your service in the tent of meeting.

\s1 Laws for Purification
\p \v 1 Now the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

\v 7 Then the priest \x + \xo 19:7 \xt See Lev. 11:25\x*shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. But the priest shall be unclean until evening.

\v 22 But God’s anger was kindled because he went, \x + \xo 22:22 \xt [Ex. 4:24; 1 Chr. 21:16] \x*and the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* took his stand in the way \x + \xo 22:22 \xt ver. 32\x*as his adversary. Now he was riding on the donkey, and his two servants were with him.
\v 23 And the donkey saw the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* standing in the road, with a drawn sword in his hand. And the donkey turned aside out of the road and went into the field. And Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the road.
\v 24 Then the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, with a wall on either side.
\v 25 And when the donkey saw the angel of the \nd Lord\nd*, she pushed against the wall and pressed Balaam’s foot against the wall. So he struck her again.
\v 26 Then the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* went ahead and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right or to the left.
\v 27 When the donkey saw the angel of the \nd Lord\nd*, she lay down under Balaam. And Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.
\v 28 Then the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 22:28 \xt 2 Pet. 2:16\x*opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?”
\v 29 And Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a fool of me. I wish I had a sword in my hand, for then I would kill you.”
\v 30 And the donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Is it my habit to treat you this way?” And he said, “No.”
\p
\v 31 Then the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 22:31 \xt [Gen. 21:19; 2 Kgs. 6:17; Luke 24:16, 31]\x*opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* standing in the way, with his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed down and fell on his face.
\v 32 And the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out \x + \xo 22:32 \xt ver. 22\x*to oppose you because your way is perverse\f + \fr 22:32 \ft Or \fq reckless\f* before me.
\v 33 The donkey saw me and turned aside before me these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely just now I would have killed you and let her live.”
\v 34 Then Balaam said to the angel of the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 22:34 \xt [1 Sam. 15:24; 26:21; 2 Sam. 12:13; Job 34:31, 32]\x*“I have sinned, for I did not know that you stood in the road against me. Now therefore, if it is evil in your sight, I will turn back.”
\v 35 And the angel of the \nd Lord\nd* said to Balaam, “Go with the men, \x + \xo 22:35 \xt ver. 20\x*but speak only the word that I tell you.” So Balaam went on with the princes of Balak.
\p
\v 36 When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, \x + \xo 22:36 \xt ch. 21:13\x*on the border formed by the Arnon, at the extremity of the border.
\v 37 And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not send to you to call you? Why did you not come to me? Am I not able to \x + \xo 22:37 \xt ver. 17; ch. 24:11\x*honor you?”
\v 38 Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you! Have I now any power of my own to speak anything? \x + \xo 22:38 \xt ver. 18\x*The word that God puts in my mouth, that must I speak.”
\v 39 Then Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
\v 40 And Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent for Balaam and for the princes who were with him.
\p
\v 41 And in the morning Balak took Balaam and brought him up to Bamoth-baal, and from there he saw a fraction of the people.

\s1 Balaam’s First Oracle
\p \v 1 And Balaam said to Balak, \x + \xo 23:1 \xt ver. 29\x*“Build for me here seven altars, and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
\v 2 Balak did as Balaam had said. And Balak and Balaam \x + \xo 23:2 \xt ver. 14, 30\x*offered on each altar a bull and a ram.
\v 3 And Balaam said to Balak, \x + \xo 23:3 \xt ver. 15 \x*“Stand beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps the \nd Lord\nd* will come \x + \xo 23:3 \xt [ch. 24:1]\x*to meet me, and whatever he shows me I will tell you.” And he went to a bare height,
\v 4 \x + \xo 23:4 \xt ver. 16\x*and God met Balaam. And Balaam said to him, “I have arranged the seven altars and I have offered on each altar a bull and a ram.”
\v 5 And the \nd Lord\nd* \x + \xo 23:5 \xt ver. 12, 16; ch. 22:38; Deut. 18:18; Isa. 51:16; 59:21; Jer. 1:9\x*put a word in Balaam’s mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”
\v 6 And he returned to him, and behold, he and all the princes of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering.
\v 7 And Balaam \x + \xo 23:7 \xt ver. 18; ch. 24:3, 15, 20, 21, 23; Job 27:1; 29:1; Ps. 49:4; 78:2; Isa. 14:4; Mic. 2:4; [ch. 21:27] \x*took up his discourse and said,
\b
\q1 “From \x + \xo 23:7 \xt [ch. 22:5] \x*Aram Balak has brought me,
\q2 the king of Moab \x + \xo 23:7 \xt [Gen. 29:1] \x*from the eastern mountains:
\q1 ‘Come, \x + \xo 23:7 \xt ch. 22:6\x*curse Jacob for me,
\q2 and come, denounce Israel!’
\q1
\v 8 How can I curse whom God has not cursed?
\q2 How can I denounce whom the \nd Lord\nd* has not denounced?
\q1
\v 9 For from the top of the crags \x + \xo 23:9 \xt [ch. 24:17] \x*I see him,
\q2 from the hills I behold him;
\q1 behold, \x + \xo 23:9 \xt Deut. 32:28 \x*a people dwelling alone,
\q2 and \x + \xo 23:9 \xt Ex. 33:16; [Ezra 9:2; Esth. 3:8; Eph. 2:14]\x*not counting itself among the nations!
\q1
\v 10 \x + \xo 23:10 \xt See Gen. 13:16 \x*Who can count the dust of Jacob
\q2 or number the fourth part\f + \fr 23:10 \ft Or \fq dust clouds\f* of Israel?
\q1 Let me die \x + \xo 23:10 \xt Ps. 37:37; 116:15; Rev. 14:13\x*the death of the upright,
\q2 and let my end be like his!”
\b
\p
\v 11 And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? \x + \xo 23:11 \xt ch. 22:11; 24:10; Deut. 23:5; Neh. 13:2\x*I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have done nothing but bless them.”
\v 12 And he answered and said, \x + \xo 23:12 \xt See ver. 5\x*“Must I not take care to speak what the \nd Lord\nd* puts in my mouth?”
\s1 Balaam’s Second Oracle
\p
\v 13 And Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place, from which you may see them. You shall see only a fraction of them and shall not see them all. Then curse them for me from there.”
\v 14 And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, \x + \xo 23:14 \xt ver. 1, 2\x*and built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
\v 15 Balaam said to Balak, \x + \xo 23:15 \xt ver. 3\x*“Stand here beside your burnt offering, while I meet the \nd Lord\nd* over there.”
\v 16 And the \nd Lord\nd* met Balaam and \x + \xo 23:16 \xt ver. 5, 12\x*put a word in his mouth and said, “Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.”
\v 17 And he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the \nd Lord\nd* spoken?”
\v 18 And Balaam took up his discourse and said,
\b
\q1 “Rise, Balak, and hear;
\q2 give ear to me, O son of Zippor:
\q1
\v 19 \x + \xo 23:19 \xt 1 Sam. 15:29; Mal. 3:6; Rom. 11:29; Titus 1:2; Heb. 6:18; James 1:17\x*God is not man, that he should lie,
\q2 or a son of man, that he should change his mind.
\q1 Has he said, and will he not do it?
\q2 Or has he spoken, and will he not fulfill it?
\q1
\v 20 Behold, I received a command to bless:
\q2 \x + \xo 23:20 \xt ch. 22:12; Gen. 12:2; 22:17 \x*he has blessed, and \x + \xo 23:20 \xt ch. 22:18\x*I cannot revoke it.
\q1
\v 21 \x + \xo 23:21 \xt [Jer. 50:20]\x*He has not beheld misfortune in Jacob,
\q2 nor has he seen trouble in Israel.
\q1 The \nd Lord\nd* their God is with them,
\q2 and the shout of a king is among them.
\q1
\v 22 \x + \xo 23:22 \xt ch. 24:8 \x*God brings them out of Egypt
\q2 and is for them like \x + \xo 23:22 \xt Deut. 33:17; Job 39:9-12; Ps. 22:21; 92:10\x*the horns of the wild ox.
\q1
\v 23 For there is no enchantment against Jacob,
\q2 no \x + \xo 23:23 \xt ch. 22:7 \x*divination against Israel;
\q1 now it shall be said of Jacob and Israel,
\q2 \x + \xo 23:23 \xt Ps. 44:1\x*‘What has God wrought!’
\q1
\v 24 Behold, a people! \x + \xo 23:24 \xt Gen. 49:9 \x*As a lioness it rises up
\q2 and as a lion it lifts itself;
\q1 \x + \xo 23:24 \xt Gen. 49:27\x*it does not lie down until it has devoured the prey
\q2 and drunk the blood of the slain.”
\b
\p
\v 25 And Balak said to Balaam, “Do not curse them at all, and do not bless them at all.”
\v 26 But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not tell you, \x + \xo 23:26 \xt See ch. 22:18\x*‘All that the \nd Lord\nd* says, that I must do’?”
\v 27 And Balak said to Balaam, \x + \xo 23:27 \xt ver. 13\x*“Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God that you may curse them for me from there.”
\v 28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of \x + \xo 23:28 \xt ch. 25:18; 31:16; Josh. 22:17; Ps. 106:28, 29; Hos. 9:10; [ch. 25:3, 5] \x*Peor, which overlooks \x + \xo 23:28 \xt See ch. 21:20\x*the desert.\f + \fr 23:28 \ft Or \fq Jeshimon\f*
\v 29 And Balaam said to Balak, \x + \xo 23:29 \xt ver. 1\x*“Build for me here seven altars and prepare for me here seven bulls and seven rams.”
\v 30 \x + \xo 23:30 \xt ver. 2\x*And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
\c 24
\s1 Balaam’s Third Oracle
\p \v 1 When Balaam saw that it pleased the \nd Lord\nd* to bless Israel, he did not go, as at \x + \xo 24:1 \xt ch. 23:3, 15\x*other times, to look for omens, but set his face toward the wilderness.
\v 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes and saw Israel \x + \xo 24:2 \xt See ch. 2:22-31 \x*camping tribe by tribe. And \x + \xo 24:2 \xt Judg. 3:10; 1 Sam. 19:20, 23; 2 Chr. 15:1; 20:14\x*the Spirit of God came upon him,
\v 3 and he \x + \xo 24:3 \xt See ch. 23:7\x*took up his discourse and said,
\b
\q1 “The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
\q2 the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,\f + \fr 24:3 \ft Or \fq closed\ft , or \fq perfect\ft ; also verse 15\f*
\q1
\v 4 the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
\q2 who sees the vision of the Almighty,
\q2 \x + \xo 24:4 \xt [Ezek. 1:28; 3:23; Rev. 1:10, 17]\x*falling down with his eyes uncovered:
\q1
\v 5 How lovely are your tents, O Jacob,
\q2 your encampments, O Israel!
\q1
\v 6 Like palm groves\f + \fr 24:6 \ft Or \fq valleys\f* that stretch afar,
\q2 like gardens beside a river,
\q1 \x + \xo 24:6 \xt [Ps. 1:3; Jer. 17:8] \x*like aloes \x + \xo 24:6 \xt Ps. 104:16; Isa. 61:3\x*that the \nd Lord\nd* has planted,
\q2 like cedar trees beside the waters.
\q1
\v 7 Water shall flow from his buckets,
\q2 and his seed shall be \x + \xo 24:7 \xt [Jer. 51:13; Rev. 17:1] \x*in many waters;
\q1 his king shall be higher than \x + \xo 24:7 \xt 1 Sam. 15:8 \x*Agag,
\q2 and \x + \xo 24:7 \xt 2 Sam. 5:12; 1 Chr. 14:2\x*his kingdom shall be exalted.
\q1
\v 8 God brings him out of Egypt
\q2 and is for him like the \x + \xo 24:8 \xt See ch. 23:22 \x*horns of the wild ox;
\q1 he shall \x + \xo 24:8 \xt [ch. 14:9; 23:24] \x*eat up the nations, his adversaries,
\q2 and shall \x + \xo 24:8 \xt Isa. 38:13; Jer. 50:17 \x*break their bones in pieces
\q2 and \x + \xo 24:8 \xt Ps. 45:5; Jer. 50:9\x*pierce them through with his arrows.
\q1
\v 9 He crouched, he lay down like a lion
\q2 and \x + \xo 24:9 \xt ch. 23:24; Gen. 49:9 \x*like a lioness; who will rouse him up?
\q1 \x + \xo 24:9 \xt Gen. 12:3; 27:29\x*Blessed are those who bless you,
\q2 and cursed are those who curse you.”
\b
\p
\v 10 And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he \x + \xo 24:10 \xt [Job 27:23; Lam. 2:15; Ezek. 21:14, 17; 22:13] \x*struck his hands together. And Balak said to Balaam, \x + \xo 24:10 \xt See ch. 23:11\x*“I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them these three times.
\v 11 Therefore now flee to your own place. I said, \x + \xo 24:11 \xt ch. 22:17, 37\x*‘I will certainly honor you,’ but the \nd Lord\nd* has held you back from honor.”
\v 12 And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you sent to me,
\v 13 \x + \xo 24:13 \xt ch. 22:18 \x*‘If Balak should give me his house full of silver and gold, I would not be able to go beyond the word of the \nd Lord\nd*, to do either good or bad \x + \xo 24:13 \xt See ch. 16:28\x*of my own will. What the \nd Lord\nd* speaks, that will I speak’?
\v 14 And now, behold, I am going to my people. Come, \x + \xo 24:14 \xt [Mic. 6:5; Rev. 2:14] \x*I will let you know what this people will do to your people \x + \xo 24:14 \xt See Gen. 49:1\x*in the latter days.”
\s1 Balaam’s Final Oracle
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 24:15 \xt [ch. 21:27]; See ch. 23:7\x*And he took up his discourse and said,
\b
\q1 “The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,
\q2 the oracle of the man whose eye is opened,
\q1
\v 16 the oracle of him who hears the words of God,
\q2 and knows the knowledge of \x + \xo 24:16 \xt Acts 7:48 \x*the Most High,
\q1 who sees the vision of the Almighty,

\q2 and break down all the sons of Sheth.
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 24:18 \xt [2 Sam. 8:14; Ps. 60:8, 9; Amos 9:12] \x*Edom shall be dispossessed;

\q2 Israel is doing valiantly.
\q1
\v 19 And one from Jacob shall exercise dominion
\q2 and destroy the survivors of cities!”
\b
\p
\v 20 Then he looked on Amalek and \x + \xo 24:20 \xt See ch. 23:7 \x*took up his discourse and said,
\b
\q1 “Amalek was the first among the nations,
\q2 \x + \xo 24:20 \xt [Ex. 17:14; 1 Sam. 15:3, 8]\x*but its end is utter destruction.”
\b
\p
\v 21 And he looked on the Kenite, and took up his discourse and said,
\b
\q1 “Enduring is your dwelling place,
\q2 and your nest is set in the rock.
\q1
\v 22 Nevertheless, Kain shall be burned
\q2 when Asshur takes you away captive.”
\b
\p
\v 23 And he took up his discourse and said,
\b
\q1 “Alas, who shall live when God does this?
\q2
\v 24 But ships shall come from \x + \xo 24:24 \xt Gen. 10:4; Dan. 11:30 \x*Kittim
\q1 and shall afflict Asshur and \x + \xo 24:24 \xt Gen. 10:21, 25 \x*Eber;
\q2 and he too \x + \xo 24:24 \xt ver. 20\x*shall come to utter destruction.”
\b
\p
\v 25 Then Balaam rose and \x + \xo 24:25 \xt [ch. 31:8]\x*went back to his place. And Balak also went his way.
\c 25
\s1 Baal Worship at Peor
\p \v 1 While Israel lived in \x + \xo 25:1 \xt ch. 33:49; Josh. 2:1; 3:1; Mic. 6:5 \x*Shittim, \x + \xo 25:1 \xt [ch. 31:16]\x*the people began to whore with the daughters of Moab.
\v 2 \x + \xo 25:2 \xt Ex. 34:15, 16; Josh. 22:17; Ps. 106:28; Hos. 9:10; [1 Cor. 10:20]\x*These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
\v 3 So Israel yoked himself to Baal of Peor. And the anger of the \nd Lord\nd* was kindled against Israel.
\v 4 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses, \x + \xo 25:4 \xt See Deut. 4:3 \x*“Take all the chiefs of the people and \x + \xo 25:4 \xt [Deut. 21:23; 2 Sam. 21:6; Gal. 3:13] \x*hang\f + \fr 25:4 \ft Or \fq impale\f* them in the sun before the \nd Lord\nd*, \x + \xo 25:4 \xt ver. 11; Deut. 13:17\x*that the fierce anger of the \nd Lord\nd* may turn away from Israel.”
\v 5 And Moses said to \x + \xo 25:5 \xt [ch. 11:16; Ex. 18:21, 25] \x*the judges of Israel, \x + \xo 25:5 \xt [Ex. 32:27]\x*“Each of you kill those of his men who have yoked themselves to Baal of Peor.”
\p
\v 6 And behold, one of the people of Israel came and brought a Midianite woman to his family, in the sight of Moses and in the sight of the whole congregation of the people of Israel, while they were \x + \xo 25:6 \xt Joel 2:17\x*weeping in the entrance of the tent of meeting.
\v 7 \x + \xo 25:7 \xt Ps. 106:30 \x*When Phinehas \x + \xo 25:7 \xt Ex. 6:25\x*the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose and left the congregation and took a spear in his hand
\v 8 and went after the man of Israel into the chamber and pierced both of them, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. Thus the plague on the people of Israel was stopped.
\v 9 Nevertheless, \x + \xo 25:9 \xt Deut. 4:3; [1 Cor. 10:8]\x*those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.
\s1 The Zeal of Phinehas
\p
\v 10 And the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses,
\v 11 “Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, has turned back my wrath from the people of Israel, in that he \x + \xo 25:11 \xt [2 Cor. 11:2] \x*was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I did not consume the people of Israel in \x + \xo 25:11 \xt Deut. 32:16, 21; 1 Kgs. 14:22; Ps. 78:58; Zeph. 1:18; 3:8; 1 Cor. 10:22; [Ex. 20:5]\x*my jealousy.
\v 12 Therefore say, \x + \xo 25:12 \xt Mal. 2:4, 5\x*‘Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace,

\p
\v 14 The name of the slain man of Israel, who was killed with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, chief of a father’s house belonging to the Simeonites.
\v 15 And the name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of \x + \xo 25:15 \xt ch. 31:8; Josh. 13:21\x*Zur, who was the tribal head of a father’s house in Midian.
\p
\v 16 And the \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 17 \x + \xo 25:17 \xt ch. 31:2, 7\x*“Harass the Midianites and strike them down,
\v 18 for they have harassed you with their \x + \xo 25:18 \xt ch. 31:16; Rev. 2:14 \x*wiles, with which they beguiled you in the matter of \x + \xo 25:18 \xt See ch. 23:28\x*Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the chief of Midian, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague on account of Peor.”
\c 26
\s1 Census of the New Generation
\p \v 1 \x + \xo 26:1 \xt ch. 25:9\x*After the plague, the \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest,

\v 3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them \x + \xo 26:3 \xt ver. 63; See ch. 22:1\x*in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

\v 22 And Moses did as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded him. He took Joshua and made him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation,

\v 4 and her father hears of her vow and of her pledge by which she has bound herself and says nothing to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand.
\v 5 But if her father opposes her on the day that he hears of it, no vow of hers, no pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand. And the \nd Lord\nd* will forgive her, because her father opposed her.

\v 6 “If she marries a husband, while under her \x + \xo 30:6 \xt Ps. 56:12\x*vows or any thoughtless utterance of her lips by which she has bound herself,

\v 10 And if she vowed in her husband’s house or bound herself by a pledge with an oath,
\v 11 and her husband heard of it and said nothing to her and did not oppose her, then all her vows shall stand, and every pledge by which she bound herself shall stand.
\v 12 But if her husband makes them null and void on the day that he hears them, then whatever proceeds out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning her pledge of herself shall not stand. Her husband has made them void, and \x + \xo 30:12 \xt ver. 8\x*the \nd Lord\nd* will forgive her.

\v 16 These are the statutes that the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses about a man and his wife and about a father and his daughter while she is in her youth within her father’s house.

\s1 Vengeance on Midian
\p \v 1 The \nd Lord\nd* spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 \x + \xo 31:2 \xt ch. 25:17 \x*“Avenge the people of Israel on the Midianites. Afterward you shall \x + \xo 31:2 \xt See ch. 20:24\x*be gathered to your people.”
\v 3 So Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for the war, that they may go against Midian to execute the \nd Lord\nd*’s vengeance on Midian.
\v 4 You shall send a thousand from each of the tribes of Israel to the war.”
\v 5 So there were provided, out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe, twelve thousand \x + \xo 31:5 \xt ch. 32:27; Josh. 4:13\x*armed for war.
\v 6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand from each tribe, together with Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, with the vessels of the sanctuary and \x + \xo 31:6 \xt ch. 10:6, 9; Lev. 23:24\x*the trumpets for the alarm in his hand.
\v 7 They warred against Midian, as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses, and \x + \xo 31:7 \xt [Deut. 20:13; Judg. 21:11; 1 Sam. 27:9; 1 Kgs. 11:15, 16]\x*killed every male.
\v 8 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain, \x + \xo 31:8 \xt Josh. 13:21 \x*Evi, Rekem, \x + \xo 31:8 \xt ch. 25:15 \x*Zur, Hur, and Reba, the five kings of Midian. And they also killed \x + \xo 31:8 \xt Josh. 13:22\x*Balaam the son of Beor with the sword.
\v 9 And the people of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and they took as plunder all their cattle, their flocks, and all their goods.
\v 10 All their cities in the places where they lived, and all their \x + \xo 31:10 \xt Gen. 25:16\x*encampments, they burned with fire,
\v 11 \x + \xo 31:11 \xt [Deut. 20:14; Josh. 8:2]\x*and took all the spoil and all the plunder, both of man and of beast.
\v 12 Then they brought the captives and the plunder and the spoil to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the people of Israel, at the camp on \x + \xo 31:12 \xt See ch. 22:1\x*the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
\p
\v 13 Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation went to meet them outside the camp.
\v 14 And Moses was angry with \x + \xo 31:14 \xt ver. 48\x*the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, who had come from service in the war.
\v 15 Moses said to them, “Have you \x + \xo 31:15 \xt [1 Sam. 15:3]\x*let all the women live?
\v 16 Behold, \x + \xo 31:16 \xt ch. 25:2 \x*these, \x + \xo 31:16 \xt ch. 24:14; 2 Pet. 2:15; Rev. 2:14 \x*on Balaam’s advice, caused the people of Israel to act treacherously against the \nd Lord\nd* in the incident of \x + \xo 31:16 \xt See ch. 23:28 \x*Peor, and so \x + \xo 31:16 \xt ch. 25:9\x*the plague came among the congregation of the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 17 Now therefore, \x + \xo 31:17 \xt Judg. 21:11, 12\x*kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman who has known man by lying with him.
\v 18 But all the young girls who have not known man by lying with him \x + \xo 31:18 \xt See Deut. 21:10-14\x*keep alive for yourselves.
\v 19 \x + \xo 31:19 \xt ch. 5:2 \x*Encamp outside the camp seven days. Whoever of you has killed any person and \x + \xo 31:19 \xt See ch. 19:12, 22\x*whoever has touched any slain, purify yourselves and your captives on the third day and on the seventh day.
\v 20 You shall purify every garment, every article of skin, all work of goats’ hair, and every article of wood.”
\p
\v 21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the men in the army who had gone to battle: “This is the statute of the law that the \nd Lord\nd* has commanded Moses:
\v 22 only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\v 23 everything that can stand the fire, you shall pass through the fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless, it shall also be purified \x + \xo 31:23 \xt ch. 19:9\x*with the water for impurity. And whatever cannot stand the fire, you shall pass through the water.
\v 24 You must \x + \xo 31:24 \xt See Lev. 11:25\x*wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean. And afterward you may come into the camp.”
\p
\v 25 The \nd Lord\nd* said to Moses,
\v 26 “Take the count of the plunder that was taken, both of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the congregation,
\v 27 and \x + \xo 31:27 \xt Josh. 22:8; 1 Sam. 30:24\x*divide the plunder into two parts between the warriors who went out to battle and all the congregation.
\v 28 And levy for the \nd Lord\nd* a tribute from the men of war who went out to battle, \x + \xo 31:28 \xt [ch. 18:26]; See ver. 30-41, 47\x*one out of five hundred, of the people and of the oxen and of the donkeys and of the flocks.
\v 29 Take it from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest as a contribution to the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 30 And from the people of Israel’s half you shall take \x + \xo 31:30 \xt See ver. 42-47 \x*one drawn out of every fifty, of the people, of the oxen, of the donkeys, and of the flocks, of all the cattle, and give them to the Levites \x + \xo 31:30 \xt See ch. 1:53\x*who keep guard over the tabernacle of the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses.
\p
\v 32 Now the plunder remaining of the spoil that the army took was 675,000 sheep,
\v 33 72,000 cattle,
\v 34 61,000 donkeys,
\v 35 and 32,000 persons in all, women who had not known man by lying with him.
\v 36 And the half, the portion of those who had gone out in the army, numbered 337,500 sheep,
\v 37 and \x + \xo 31:37 \xt ver. 28\x*the \nd Lord\nd*’s tribute of sheep was 675.
\v 38 The cattle were 36,000, of which the \nd Lord\nd*’s tribute was 72.
\v 39 The donkeys were 30,500, of which the \nd Lord\nd*’s tribute was 61.
\v 40 The persons were 16,000, of which the \nd Lord\nd*’s tribute was 32 persons.
\v 41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the contribution for the \nd Lord\nd*, to Eleazar the priest, \x + \xo 31:41 \xt [ch. 18:8, 19]\x*as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses.
\p
\v 42 From the people of Israel’s half, which Moses separated from that of the men who had served in the army—
\v 43 now the congregation’s half was 337,500 sheep,
\v 44 36,000 cattle,
\v 45 and 30,500 donkeys,
\v 46 and 16,000 persons—
\v 47 \x + \xo 31:47 \xt ver. 30\x*from the people of Israel’s half Moses took one of every 50, both of persons and of beasts, and gave them to the Levites who kept guard over the tabernacle of the \nd Lord\nd*, as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses.
\p
\v 48 Then \x + \xo 31:48 \xt ver. 14\x*the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, came near to Moses
\v 49 and said to Moses, “Your servants have counted the men of war who are under our command, and there is not a man missing from us.
\v 50 And we have brought the \nd Lord\nd*’s offering, what each man found, articles of gold, armlets and bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and beads, \x + \xo 31:50 \xt See Ex. 30:12\x*to make atonement for ourselves before the \nd Lord\nd*.”
\v 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest received from them the gold, all crafted articles.
\v 52 And all the gold of the contribution that they presented to the \nd Lord\nd*, from the commanders of thousands and the commanders of hundreds, was 16,750 shekels.\f + \fr 31:52 \ft A \fq shekel \ft was about 2/5 ounce or 11 grams\f*
\v 53 \x + \xo 31:53 \xt ver. 32; Deut. 20:14\x*(The men in the army had each taken plunder for himself.)
\v 54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, \x + \xo 31:54 \xt Ex. 30:16\x*as a memorial for the people of Israel before the \nd Lord\nd*.
\c 32
\s1 Reuben and Gad Settle in Gilead
\p \v 1 Now the people of Reuben and the people of Gad had a very great number of livestock. And they saw the land of \x + \xo 32:1 \xt ver. 3, 35; See ch. 21:32\x*Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place for livestock.
\v 2 So the people of Gad and the people of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the chiefs of the congregation,
\v 3 \x + \xo 32:3 \xt ver. 34 \x*“Ataroth, \x + \xo 32:3 \xt ver. 34; See ch. 21:30 \x*Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, \x + \xo 32:3 \xt ver. 38; ch. 33:47; Deut. 32:49; 1 Chr. 5:8; Isa. 15:2; 46:1; Jer. 48:1, 22\x*Nebo, and Beon,
\v 4 the land \x + \xo 32:4 \xt ch. 21:24, 34; [ver. 33]\x*that the \nd Lord\nd* struck down before the congregation of Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”
\v 5 And they said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession. Do not take us across the Jordan.”
\p
\v 6 But Moses said to the people of Gad and to the people of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to the war while you sit here?
\v 7 Why will you discourage the heart of the people of Israel from going over into the land that the \nd Lord\nd* has given them?
\v 8 Your fathers did this, \x + \xo 32:8 \xt See ch. 13:3, 21-33; Deut. 1:22-28\x*when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
\v 9 For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the people of Israel from going into the land that the \nd Lord\nd* had given them.
\v 10 \x + \xo 32:10 \xt For ver. 10-12, see Deut. 1:34-36\x*And the \nd Lord\nd*’s anger was kindled on that day, and he swore, saying,
\v 11 ‘Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, \x + \xo 32:11 \xt ch. 14:29 \x*from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land that I swore to give \x + \xo 32:11 \xt See Gen. 50:24\x*to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me,
\v 12 none except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the \x + \xo 32:12 \xt Josh. 14:6; 15:17 \x*Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for \x + \xo 32:12 \xt ch. 14:24; Deut. 1:36; Josh. 14:8, 9\x*they have wholly followed the \nd Lord\nd*.’
\v 13 And the \nd Lord\nd*’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them \x + \xo 32:13 \xt See ch. 14:33-35 \x*wander in the wilderness forty years, until \x + \xo 32:13 \xt ch. 26:64, 65\x*all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the \nd Lord\nd* was gone.
\v 14 And behold, you have risen in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to increase still more the fierce anger of the \nd Lord\nd* against Israel!
\v 15 For if you \x + \xo 32:15 \xt [Deut. 30:17; Josh. 22:16, 18; 2 Chr. 7:19, 20; 15:2]\x*turn away from following him, he will again abandon them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all this people.”
\p
\v 16 Then they came near to him and said, \x + \xo 32:16 \xt ver. 24\x*“We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones,
\v 17 but \x + \xo 32:17 \xt Josh. 4:12, 13\x*we will take up arms, ready to go before the people of Israel, until we have brought them to their place. And our little ones shall live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
\v 18 \x + \xo 32:18 \xt Josh. 22:4\x*We will not return to our homes until each of the people of Israel has gained his inheritance.
\v 19 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan and beyond, \x + \xo 32:19 \xt ver. 33; Josh. 12:1; 13:8\x*because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan to the east.”
\v 20 So \x + \xo 32:20 \xt Deut. 3:18; Josh. 1:13, 14; 4:12, 13\x*Moses said to them, “If you will do this, if you will take up arms to go before the \nd Lord\nd* for the war,
\v 21 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before the \nd Lord\nd*, until he has \x + \xo 32:21 \xt ch. 33:52\x*driven out his enemies from before him
\v 22 and the land is subdued before the \nd Lord\nd*; then after that you shall return and be free of obligation to the \nd Lord\nd* and to Israel, and \x + \xo 32:22 \xt Deut. 3:12, 15, 16, 18; Josh. 1:15; 13:8, 32; 22:4, 9\x*this land shall be your possession before the \nd Lord\nd*.
\v 23 But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the \nd Lord\nd*, and \x + \xo 32:23 \xt [Gen. 44:16; Isa. 59:12]\x*be sure your sin will find you out.
\v 24 \x + \xo 32:24 \xt ver. 16; See ver. 34-38\x*Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep, and do what you have promised.”
\v 25 And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben said to Moses, “Your servants will do as my lord commands.
\v 26 \x + \xo 32:26 \xt Josh. 1:14\x*Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle shall remain there in the cities of Gilead,

\p
\v 28 So \x + \xo 32:28 \xt Josh. 1:13 \x*Moses gave command concerning them to Eleazar the priest and to \x + \xo 32:28 \xt ch. 27:18\x*Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the people of Israel.
\v 29 And Moses said to them, “If the people of Gad and the people of Reuben, every man who is armed to battle before the \nd Lord\nd*, will pass with you over the Jordan and the land shall be subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession.
\v 30 However, if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.”
\v 31 And the people of Gad and the people of Reuben answered, “What the \nd Lord\nd* has said to your servants, we will do.
\v 32 We will pass over armed before the \nd Lord\nd* into the land of Canaan, and the possession of our inheritance shall remain with us beyond the Jordan.”

\v 7 The inheritance of the people of Israel shall not be transferred from one tribe to another, for every one of the people of Israel \x + \xo 36:7 \xt [1 Kgs. 21:3]\x*shall hold on to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
\v 8 And \x + \xo 36:8 \xt 1 Chr. 23:22\x*every daughter who possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the people of Israel shall be wife to one of the clan of the tribe of her father, so that every one of the people of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers.
\v 9 So no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another, for each of the tribes of the people of Israel shall hold on to its own inheritance.’”
\p
\v 10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as the \nd Lord\nd* commanded Moses,
\v 11 \x + \xo 36:11 \xt ch. 27:1; Josh. 17:3\x*for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to sons of their father’s brothers.
\v 12 They were married into the clans of the people of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of their father’s clan.
\p
\v 13 These are the commandments and the rules that the \nd Lord\nd* commanded through Moses to the people of Israel \x + \xo 36:13 \xt See ch. 22:1\x*in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
