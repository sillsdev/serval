\b
\q1
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [Deut. 28:13, 44; Jer. 13:21] \x*Her foes have become the head;
\q2 her \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Jer. 12:1 \x*enemies prosper,
\q1 because \x + \xo 1:5 \xt ver. 12; ch. 3:33 \x*the \nd Lord\nd* has afflicted her

\b
\q1
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Zech. 13:1] \x*Jerusalem sinned grievously;

\b
\q1
\v 9 Her uncleanness was \x + \xo 1:9 \xt [Jer. 13:22] \x*in her skirts;

\q2 enter her sanctuary,
\q1 those whom you \x + \xo 1:10 \xt [Deut. 23:3; Neh. 13:1]\x*forbade

\q1 the Lord gave me into the hands
\q2 of those whom I cannot withstand.
\b
\q1
\v 15 “The Lord rejected
\q2 all my mighty men in my midst;
\q1 he summoned an assembly against me
\q2 to crush my young men;

\q2 for the enemy has prevailed.”
\b
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17 \xt Isa. 1:15; Jer. 4:31 \x*Zion stretches out her hands,
\q2 but \x + \xo 1:17 \xt [See ver. 16 above]\x*there is none to comfort her;
\q1 the \nd Lord\nd* has commanded against Jacob
\q2 that his neighbors should be his foes;
\q1 Jerusalem has become

\b
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18 \xt See Jer. 12:1 \x*“The \nd Lord\nd* is in the right,

\q1
\v 2 The Lord \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ver. 16; [Ps. 35:25; 56:2; Ezek. 36:3] \x*has swallowed up \x + \xo 2:2 \xt ver. 17, 21; ch. 3:43; [Ezek. 9:5, 10] \x*without mercy
\q2 all the habitations of Jacob;
\q1 in his wrath \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Ps. 89:40 \x*he has broken down
\q2 the strongholds of the daughter of Judah;
\q1 he has brought \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Ps. 74:7 \x*down to the ground \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Ps. 74:7 \x*in dishonor
\q2 the kingdom \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Isa. 43:28\x*and its rulers.
