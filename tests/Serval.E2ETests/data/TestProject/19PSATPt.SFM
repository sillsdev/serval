\q1
\v 1 Truly God is good to \x + \xo 73:1 \xt John 1:47 \x*Israel,
\q2 to those who are \x + \xo 73:1 \xt See Ps. 24:4\x*pure in heart.
\q1
\v 2 But as for me, my feet had almost stumbled,
\q2 my steps had nearly slipped.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 73:3 \xt See Job 21:7 \x*For I was \x + \xo 73:3 \xt Ps. 37:1; Prov. 23:17 \x*envious of the arrogant
\q2 when I saw the \x + \xo 73:3 \xt [Ps. 37:7; 92:7; Jer. 12:1]\x*prosperity of the wicked.
\b
\q1
\v 4 For they have no pangs until death;
\q2 their bodies are fat and sleek.
\q1
\v 5 They are not in trouble as others are;
\q2 they are not \x + \xo 73:5 \xt [Isa. 53:4]\x*stricken like the rest of mankind.
\q1
\v 6 Therefore pride is \x + \xo 73:6 \xt [Judg. 8:26] \x*their necklace;
\q2 violence covers them as \x + \xo 73:6 \xt [Ps. 109:18]\x*a garment.
\q1
\v 7 Their \x + \xo 73:7 \xt See Job 15:27\x*eyes swell out through fatness;
\q2 their hearts overflow with follies.
\q1
\v 8 They scoff and \x + \xo 73:8 \xt [2 Pet. 2:18; Jude 16]\x*speak with malice;
\q2 loftily they threaten oppression.
\q1
\v 9 They set their mouths against the heavens,
\q2 and their tongue struts through the earth.
\q1
\v 10 Therefore his people turn back to them,
\q2 and find \x + \xo 73:10 \xt [Job 15:16]\x*no fault in them.\f + \fr 73:10 \ft Probable reading; Hebrew \fq the waters of a full cup are drained by them\f*
\q1
\v 11 And they say, \x + \xo 73:11 \xt See Job 22:13\x*“How can God know?
\q2 Is there knowledge in the Most High?”
\q1
\v 12 Behold, these are the wicked;
\q2 always at ease, they \x + \xo 73:12 \xt [ver. 3]\x*increase in riches.
\q1
\v 13 All in vain have I \x + \xo 73:13 \xt [ver. 1]; See Job 34:9 \x*kept my heart clean
\q2 and \x + \xo 73:13 \xt See Ps. 26:6\x*washed my hands in innocence.
\q1
\v 14 For all the day long I have been \x + \xo 73:14 \xt [See ver. 5 above] \x*stricken
\q2 and \x + \xo 73:14 \xt Rev. 3:19 \x*rebuked \x + \xo 73:14 \xt [Ps. 101:8]\x*every morning.
\q1
\v 15 If I had said, “I will speak thus,”
\q2 I would have betrayed \x + \xo 73:15 \xt [Ps. 14:5]\x*the generation of your children.
\b
\q1
\v 16 But when I thought how to understand this,
\q2 it seemed to me \x + \xo 73:16 \xt Eccles. 8:17\x*a wearisome task,
\q1
\v 17 until I went into \x + \xo 73:17 \xt Ps. 20:2 \x*the sanctuary of God;
\q2 then I discerned their \x + \xo 73:17 \xt Ps. 37:38\x*end.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Truly you set them in \x + \xo 73:18 \xt Ps. 35:6\x*slippery places;
\q2 you make them fall to ruin.
\q1
\v 19 How they are destroyed \x + \xo 73:19 \xt [Num. 16:21] \x*in a moment,
\q2 swept away utterly by \x + \xo 73:19 \xt See Job 18:11\x*terrors!
\q1
\v 20 Like \x + \xo 73:20 \xt See Job 20:8 \x*a dream when one awakes,
\q2 O Lord, when \x + \xo 73:20 \xt Ps. 78:65\x*you rouse yourself, you despise them as phantoms.
\q1
\v 21 When my soul was embittered,
\q2 when I was pricked in heart,
\q1
\v 22 I was \x + \xo 73:22 \xt See Ps. 49:10 \x*brutish and ignorant;
\q2 I was like \x + \xo 73:22 \xt Job 18:3; [Job 11:12]\x*a beast toward you.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Nevertheless, I am continually with you;
\q2 you \x + \xo 73:23 \xt Ps. 63:8; [Ps. 41:12]\x*hold my right hand.
\q1
\v 24 You \x + \xo 73:24 \xt Ps. 32:8 \x*guide me with your counsel,
\q2 and afterward you will \x + \xo 73:24 \xt See Ps. 49:15\x*receive me to glory.
\q1
\v 25 \x + \xo 73:25 \xt Ps. 16:2; [Phil. 3:8]\x*Whom have I in heaven but you?
\q2 And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
\q1
\v 26 \x + \xo 73:26 \xt Ps. 40:12; See Ps. 84:2 \x*My flesh and my heart may fail,
\q2 but God is \x + \xo 73:26 \xt Ps. 18:2 \x*the strength\f + \fr 73:26 \ft Hebrew \fq rock\f* of my heart and my \x + \xo 73:26 \xt See Ps. 16:5 \x*portion \x + \xo 73:26 \xt [Dan. 12:3]\x*forever.
\b
\q1
\v 27 For behold, those who are \x + \xo 73:27 \xt Ps. 119:155 \x*far from you shall perish;
\q2 you put an end to everyone who is \x + \xo 73:27 \xt Ps. 106:39; Ex. 34:15; Num. 15:39; James 4:4\x*unfaithful to you.
\q1
\v 28 But for me it is good to \x + \xo 73:28 \xt James 4:8; [Heb. 10:22] \x*be near God;
\q2 I have made the Lord \nd God\nd* my \x + \xo 73:28 \xt See Ps. 14:6 \x*refuge,

\q1
\v 7 They \x + \xo 74:7 \xt 2 Kgs. 25:9; [Ps. 79:1] \x*set your sanctuary on fire;
