\s1 Greeting
\p
\v 1 Paul, \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Acts 15:22; 2 Cor. 1:19; 2 Thess. 1:1; 1 Pet. 5:12 \x*Silvanus, and Timothy,
\p To the church of the \x + \xo 1:1 \xt See Acts 17:1 \x*Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
\p \x + \xo 1:1 \xt Rom. 1:7\x*Grace to you and peace.
\s1 The Thessalonians’ Faith and Example
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2 \xt ch. 2:13; See Rom. 1:8; Eph. 5:20 \x*We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly\f + \fr 1:2 \ft Or \fq without ceasing\f* \x + \xo 1:2 \xt Rom. 1:9; 2 Tim. 1:3\x*mentioning you in our prayers,
\v 3 remembering before \x + \xo 1:3 \xt See Gal. 1:4 \x*our God and Father \x + \xo 1:3 \xt 2 Thess. 1:11; [John 6:29; Gal. 5:6; Heb. 6:10; James 2:22] \x*your work of faith and labor of \x + \xo 1:3 \xt 2 Thess. 1:3, 4; [Col. 1:4; 1 Tim. 1:14; Rev. 2:19] \x*love and \x + \xo 1:3 \xt Rom. 8:25; 15:4\x*steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
\v 4 For we know, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt 2 Thess. 2:13 \x*brothers\f + \fr 1:4 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft . The plural Greek word \+tl adelphoi\+tl* (translated “brothers”) refers to siblings in a family. In New Testament usage, depending on the context, \+tl adelphoi\+tl* may refer either to men or to both men and women who are siblings (brothers and sisters) in God’s family, the church\f* loved by God, \x + \xo 1:4 \xt 2 Pet. 1:10\x*that he has chosen you,
\v 5 because \x + \xo 1:5 \xt 2 Thess. 2:14 \x*our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and \x + \xo 1:5 \xt 2 Cor. 6:6; See 1 Cor. 2:4 \x*in the Holy Spirit and with full \x + \xo 1:5 \xt Col. 2:2; [Heb. 2:3] \x*conviction. You know \x + \xo 1:5 \xt [ch. 2:10; Acts 20:18; 2 Thess. 3:7]\x*what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
\v 6 And \x + \xo 1:6 \xt [ch. 2:14; 2 Thess. 3:7, 9]; See 1 Cor. 4:16 \x*you became imitators of us \x + \xo 1:6 \xt 1 Cor. 11:1 \x*and of the Lord, for \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Acts 17:5-10 \x*you received the word in much affliction, \x + \xo 1:6 \xt See Matt. 5:12 \x*with the \x + \xo 1:6 \xt Acts 13:52; Gal. 5:22\x*joy of the Holy Spirit,
\v 7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
\v 8 For not only has the word of the Lord \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Rom. 10:18; 2 Thess. 3:1] \x*sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth \x + \xo 1:8 \xt [Rom. 1:8; 16:19; 2 Thess. 1:4]\x*everywhere, so that we need not say anything.
\v 9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of \x + \xo 1:9 \xt ch. 2:1 \x*reception we had among you, and how \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See Acts 14:15 \x*you turned to God \x + \xo 1:9 \xt 1 Cor. 12:2; [Gal. 4:8] \x*from idols to serve the living and \x + \xo 1:9 \xt See John 17:3\x*true God,
\v 10 and \x + \xo 1:10 \xt See 1 Cor. 1:7 \x*to wait for his Son \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 4:16; [2 Thess. 1:10]; See Acts 1:11 \x*from heaven, \x + \xo 1:10 \xt See Acts 2:24 \x*whom he raised from the dead, Jesus \x + \xo 1:10 \xt Col. 1:13 \x*who delivers us from \x + \xo 1:10 \xt ch. 2:16; 5:9; Matt. 3:7; Rom. 5:9\x*the wrath to come.

\s1 Paul’s Ministry to the Thessalonians
\p
\v 1 For you yourselves know, brothers,\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 9, 14, 17\f* that our \x + \xo 2:1 \xt ch. 1:9 \x*coming to you \x + \xo 2:1 \xt [2 Thess. 1:10]\x*was not in vain.
\v 2 But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Acts 16:22-24 \x*at Philippi, as you know, \x + \xo 2:2 \xt See Acts 4:13 \x*we had boldness in our God \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Acts 17:2-9 \x*to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much \x + \xo 2:2 \xt Phil. 1:30\x*conflict.
\v 3 For \x + \xo 2:3 \xt [2 Cor. 2:17] \x*our appeal does not spring from \x + \xo 2:3 \xt 2 Thess. 2:11 \x*error or \x + \xo 2:3 \xt ch. 4:7 \x*impurity or \x + \xo 2:3 \xt 2 Cor. 4:2\x*any attempt to deceive,
\v 4 but just as we have been approved by God \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See Gal. 2:7 \x*to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not \x + \xo 2:4 \xt See Gal. 1:10 \x*to please man, but to please God \x + \xo 2:4 \xt Ps. 17:3; See Rom. 8:27\x*who tests our hearts.
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5 \xt See Acts 20:33 \x*For we never came with words of flattery,\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Or \fq with a flattering speech\f* as you know, nor with a pretext for greed—\x + \xo 2:5 \xt ver. 10; See Rom. 1:9\x*God is witness.
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [2 Cor. 4:5]; See John 5:41 \x*Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, \x + \xo 2:6 \xt 1 Cor. 9:4; 2 Thess. 3:9; [Philem. 8, 9] \x*though we could have made \x + \xo 2:6 \xt [ver. 9; 2 Cor. 11:9] \x*demands as \x + \xo 2:6 \xt See 1 Cor. 9:1\x*apostles of Christ.
\v 7 But we were \x + \xo 2:7 \xt 2 Tim. 2:24; [1 Cor. 14:20] \x*gentle\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Some manuscripts \fq infants\f* among you, \x + \xo 2:7 \xt [ver. 11; Isa. 49:23; 60:16]\x*like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.
\v 8 So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God \x + \xo 2:8 \xt See 2 Cor. 12:15\x*but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.
\p
\v 9 For you remember, brothers, \x + \xo 2:9 \xt 2 Thess. 3:8; [Phil. 4:16] \x*our labor and toil: we \x + \xo 2:9 \xt See Acts 18:3\x*worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
\v 10 You are witnesses, and \x + \xo 2:10 \xt ver. 5 \x*God also, \x + \xo 2:10 \xt See ch. 1:5\x*how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers.
\v 11 For you know how, \x + \xo 2:11 \xt [ver. 7]; See 1 Cor. 4:14\x*like a father with his children,
\v 12 we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and \x + \xo 2:12 \xt Eph. 4:17 \x*charged \x + \xo 2:12 \xt See Eph. 4:1 \x*you to walk in a manner worthy of God, \x + \xo 2:12 \xt ch. 5:24; 2 Thess. 2:14; 1 Pet. 5:10; See Rom. 8:28\x*who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
\p
\v 13 And \x + \xo 2:13 \xt See ch. 1:2, 3 \x*we also thank God constantly\f + \fr 2:13 \ft Or \fq without ceasing\f* for this, that when you received \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Rom. 10:17] \x*the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it \x + \xo 2:13 \xt [Gal. 4:14]; See Matt. 10:20 \x*not as the word of men\f + \fr 2:13 \ft The Greek word \+tl anthropoi\+tl* can refer to both men and women\f* but as what it really is, the word of God, \x + \xo 2:13 \xt Heb. 4:12\x*which is at work in you believers.
\v 14 For you, brothers, \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See ch. 1:6 \x*became imitators of \x + \xo 2:14 \xt See 1 Cor. 7:17 \x*the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For \x + \xo 2:14 \xt ch. 3:4; Acts 17:5; 2 Thess. 1:4, 5 \x*you suffered the same things from your own countrymen \x + \xo 2:14 \xt [Heb. 10:33, 34]\x*as they did from the Jews,\f + \fr 2:14 \ft The Greek word \+tl Ioudaioi\+tl* can refer to Jewish religious leaders and others under their influence, who opposed the Christian faith in that time\f*
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15 \xt See Luke 24:20 \x*who killed both the Lord Jesus and \x + \xo 2:15 \xt Jer. 2:30; Matt. 23:29-34; See Matt. 5:12 \x*the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and \x + \xo 2:15 \xt [Esth. 3:8]\x*oppose all mankind
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16 \xt Acts 13:45, 50; 14:2, 19; 17:5, 13; 18:12; 22:21, 22 \x*by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved—so as always \x + \xo 2:16 \xt See Gen. 15:16 \x*to fill up the measure of their sins. But \x + \xo 2:16 \xt See ch. 1:10\x*wrath has come upon them at last!\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Or \fq completely\ft , or \fq forever\f*
\s1 Paul’s Longing to See Them Again
\p
\v 17 But since we were torn away from you, brothers, for a short time, \x + \xo 2:17 \xt 1 Cor. 5:3; Col. 2:5 \x*in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire \x + \xo 2:17 \xt ch. 3:10\x*to see you face to face,
\v 18 because we wanted to come to you—I, Paul, again and again—but Satan \x + \xo 2:18 \xt Rom. 15:22; [Rom. 1:13]\x*hindered us.
\v 19 For what is our hope or \x + \xo 2:19 \xt See Phil. 4:1 \x*joy or crown of boasting \x + \xo 2:19 \xt 1 Cor. 15:31; [2 Thess. 1:4]; See 2 Cor. 1:14 \x*before our Lord Jesus at his \x + \xo 2:19 \xt ch. 3:13; 4:15; 5:23; Matt. 24:3; 1 Cor. 15:23; 2 Thess. 2:1, 8; James 5:7, 8; 2 Pet. 1:16; 3:4, 12; 1 John 2:28\x*coming? Is it not you?
\v 20 For you are our glory and joy.
\c 3
\p \v 1 Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing \x + \xo 3:1 \xt Acts 17:15, 16\x*to be left behind at Athens alone,
\v 2 and we \x + \xo 3:2 \xt See Phil. 2:19 \x*sent Timothy, \x + \xo 3:2 \xt 2 Cor. 1:1; Col. 1:1; Philem. 1; Heb. 13:23\x*our brother and God’s coworker\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Some manuscripts \fq servant\f* in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith,
\v 3 that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that \x + \xo 3:3 \xt See Acts 9:16; 14:22\x*we are destined for this.
\v 4 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, \x + \xo 3:4 \xt See ch. 2:14\x*just as it has come to pass, and just as you know.
\v 5 For this reason, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt ver. 1, 2 \x*when I could bear it no longer, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt ver. 1, 2 \x*I sent to learn about your faith, \x + \xo 3:5 \xt [1 Cor. 7:5; 2 Cor. 11:3] \x*for fear that somehow \x + \xo 3:5 \xt Matt. 4:3 \x*the tempter had tempted you and \x + \xo 3:5 \xt See Phil. 2:16\x*our labor would be in vain.
\s1 Timothy’s Encouraging Report
\p
\v 6 But \x + \xo 3:6 \xt Acts 18:5; [2 Cor. 7:6, 9] \x*now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See ch. 1:3 \x*your faith and love and reported \x + \xo 3:6 \xt [1 Cor. 11:2] \x*that you always remember us kindly and \x + \xo 3:6 \xt See Phil. 1:8\x*long to see us, as we long to see you—
\v 7 for this reason, brothers,\f + \fr 3:7 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\f* in all our distress and affliction \x + \xo 3:7 \xt 2 Cor. 1:4\x*we have been comforted about you through your faith.
\v 8 For now we live, if you \x + \xo 3:8 \xt See 1 Cor. 16:13\x*are standing fast in the Lord.
\v 9 For \x + \xo 3:9 \xt [ch. 1:2]\x*what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,
\v 10 as we pray most earnestly \x + \xo 3:10 \xt 2 Tim. 1:3 \x*night and day \x + \xo 3:10 \xt ch. 2:17; [Rom. 1:10] \x*that we may see you face to face and \x + \xo 3:10 \xt See 2 Cor. 13:9\x*supply what is lacking in your faith?
\p
\v 11 Now may \x + \xo 3:11 \xt See Gal. 1:4 \x*our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, \x + \xo 3:11 \xt 2 Thess. 3:5\x*direct our way to you,
\v 12 and may the Lord \x + \xo 3:12 \xt ch. 4:1, 10; Phil. 1:9; 2 Thess. 1:3 \x*make you increase and abound in love \x + \xo 3:12 \xt ch. 4:9; 5:15\x*for one another and for all, as we do for you,
\v 13 so that he may \x + \xo 3:13 \xt James 5:8 \x*establish your hearts blameless in holiness before \x + \xo 3:13 \xt [See ver. 11 above] \x*our God and Father, at \x + \xo 3:13 \xt See ch. 2:19 \x*the coming of our Lord Jesus \x + \xo 3:13 \xt Zech. 14:5; Jude 14\x*with all his saints.
\c 4
\s1 A Life Pleasing to God
\p \v 1 Finally, then, brothers,\f + \fr 4:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 10, 13\f* we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you \x + \xo 4:1 \xt Phil. 4:9; Col. 2:6 \x*received from us \x + \xo 4:1 \xt See Eph. 4:1 \x*how you ought to walk and \x + \xo 4:1 \xt See Col. 1:10 \x*to please God, just as you are doing, that you \x + \xo 4:1 \xt See ch. 3:12\x*do so more and more.
\v 2 For \x + \xo 4:2 \xt [1 Cor. 11:2]\x*you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
\v 3 For this is the will of God, \x + \xo 4:3 \xt Rom. 6:19, 22; 1 Cor. 1:30; 2 Thess. 2:13; 1 Tim. 2:15; Heb. 12:14; 1 Pet. 1:2 \x*your sanctification:\f + \fr 4:3 \ft Or \fq your holiness\f* \x + \xo 4:3 \xt See 1 Cor. 6:18\x*that you abstain from sexual immorality;
\v 4 that each one of you know how to control his own \x + \xo 4:4 \xt 1 Pet. 3:7; [2 Cor. 4:7] \x*body\f + \fr 4:4 \ft Or \fq how to take a wife for himself\ft ; Greek \fq how to possess his own vessel\f* in holiness and \x + \xo 4:4 \xt [Rom. 1:24]\x*honor,
\v 5 not in \x + \xo 4:5 \xt See Rom. 1:26 \x*the passion of lust \x + \xo 4:5 \xt Eph. 4:17 \x*like the Gentiles \x + \xo 4:5 \xt Ps. 79:6; Jer. 9:3; 10:25; See Gal. 4:8\x*who do not know God;
\v 6 that no one transgress and \x + \xo 4:6 \xt 1 Cor. 6:8 \x*wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is \x + \xo 4:6 \xt Rom. 13:4; [Rom. 12:19; Heb. 13:4]\x*an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you.
\v 7 For \x + \xo 4:7 \xt ver. 3; See 1 Pet. 1:15 \x*God has not called us for \x + \xo 4:7 \xt ch. 2:3\x*impurity, but in holiness.
\v 8 Therefore \x + \xo 4:8 \xt [ch. 2:13]; See Luke 10:16 \x*whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, \x + \xo 4:8 \xt 1 John 3:24; 4:13\x*who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
\p
\v 9 Now concerning \x + \xo 4:9 \xt See Heb. 13:1 \x*brotherly love \x + \xo 4:9 \xt ch. 5:1 \x*you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been \x + \xo 4:9 \xt John 6:45; [1 John 2:27] \x*taught by God \x + \xo 4:9 \xt See John 13:34\x*to love one another,
\v 10 for that indeed is what \x + \xo 4:10 \xt ch. 1:7 \x*you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to \x + \xo 4:10 \xt See ch. 3:12\x*do this more and more,
\v 11 and to aspire \x + \xo 4:11 \xt Prov. 17:14; 20:3; 25:8; 2 Thess. 3:12 \x*to live quietly, and \x + \xo 4:11 \xt 2 Thess. 3:11; 1 Pet. 4:15 \x*to mind your own affairs, and \x + \xo 4:11 \xt [Acts 18:3]; See Eph. 4:28\x*to work with your hands, as we instructed you,
\v 12 so that you may \x + \xo 4:12 \xt Rom. 13:13; [Col. 4:5] \x*walk properly before \x + \xo 4:12 \xt See Mark 4:11\x*outsiders and be dependent on no one.
\s1 The Coming of the Lord
\p
\v 13 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, \x + \xo 4:13 \xt [Lev. 19:28; Deut. 14:1; 2 Sam. 12:20-23; Mark 5:39] \x*that you may not grieve as others do \x + \xo 4:13 \xt Eph. 2:12\x*who have no hope.
\v 14 For \x + \xo 4:14 \xt 1 Cor. 15:13; [2 Cor. 4:14; Rev. 1:18] \x*since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him \x + \xo 4:14 \xt 1 Cor. 15:18\x*those who have fallen asleep.
\v 15 For this we declare to you \x + \xo 4:15 \xt See 1 Kgs. 13:17 \x*by a word from the Lord,\f + \fr 4:15 \ft Or \fq by the word of the Lord\f* that \x + \xo 4:15 \xt 1 Cor. 15:51 \x*we who are alive, who are left until \x + \xo 4:15 \xt See ch. 2:19\x*the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
\v 16 For \x + \xo 4:16 \xt See Matt. 16:27 \x*the Lord himself will descend \x + \xo 4:16 \xt 2 Thess. 1:7 \x*from heaven \x + \xo 4:16 \xt [Joel 2:11] \x*with a cry of command, with the voice of \x + \xo 4:16 \xt Jude 9 \x*an archangel, and \x + \xo 4:16 \xt Matt. 24:31; 1 Cor. 15:52 \x*with the sound of the trumpet of God. And \x + \xo 4:16 \xt 1 Cor. 15:23; [2 Thess. 2:1; Rev. 14:13]\x*the dead in Christ will rise first.
\v 17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be \x + \xo 4:17 \xt See 2 Cor. 12:2 \x*caught up together with them \x + \xo 4:17 \xt [Dan. 7:13; Acts 1:9; Rev. 11:12] \x*in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so \x + \xo 4:17 \xt See John 12:26\x*we will always be with the Lord.
\v 18 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
\c 5
\s1 The Day of the Lord
\p \v 1 Now concerning \x + \xo 5:1 \xt Dan. 2:21; Acts 1:7 \x*the times and the seasons, brothers,\f + \fr 5:1 \ft Or \fq brothers and sisters\ft ; also verses 4, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27\f* \x + \xo 5:1 \xt ch. 4:9\x*you have no need to have anything written to you.
\v 2 For you yourselves are fully aware that \x + \xo 5:2 \xt [2 Thess. 2:2]; See Matt. 24:43; Luke 17:24\x*the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
\v 3 While people are saying, “There is peace and security,” then \x + \xo 5:3 \xt Luke 21:34; [Ps. 35:8; Luke 17:26-30; 2 Thess. 1:9] \x*sudden destruction will come upon them \x + \xo 5:3 \xt See Isa. 13:8\x*as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
\v 4 But you \x + \xo 5:4 \xt 1 John 2:8\x*are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.
\v 5 For you are all \x + \xo 5:5 \xt See Luke 16:8\x*children\f + \fr 5:5 \ft Or \fq sons\ft ; twice in this verse\f* of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.
\v 6 So then \x + \xo 5:6 \xt [Mark 13:36]; See Rom. 13:11-13 \x*let us not sleep, as others do, but let us \x + \xo 5:6 \xt See Matt. 24:42 \x*keep awake and \x + \xo 5:6 \xt See 1 Pet. 1:13\x*be sober.
\v 7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, \x + \xo 5:7 \xt [Acts 2:15; 2 Pet. 2:13]\x*are drunk at night.
\v 8 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, \x + \xo 5:8 \xt Isa. 59:17; Eph. 6:14, 17 \x*having put on the breastplate of \x + \xo 5:8 \xt [Eph. 6:23]\x*faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
\v 9 For God has not destined us for \x + \xo 5:9 \xt See ch. 1:10 \x*wrath, but \x + \xo 5:9 \xt 2 Thess. 2:13, 14; [Heb. 10:39]\x*to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10 \xt Rom. 14:9; [2 Tim. 2:11]\x*who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him.
\v 11 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.
\s1 Final Instructions and Benediction
